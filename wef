There are a few different combinations of chip type, reader, and software that can all work to get
you logged in to your computer quickly. | will explain the different approaches in detail below.

1S014443A chip and the KBR1

The easiest method to log into a computer is to use the KBR1 reader with an 1SO14443A.
compliant chip implant. The KBR1 is what is known as a “keyboard wedge” reader. It works
by reading the serial number of any 1S014443A chip and then “typing” that serial number as if it
were a keyboard device being typed on by a human. The KBR1 requires no special drivers
or software to operate, simply plug it in and most modern computer systems will recognize it as
an additional keyboard. Scan a chip and the serial number will be typed out into whatever
application is active at the time, including computer login password dialog boxes. The KBR1

will not read any user memory, so if your chip is 1S014443A and also NFC compliant, and you
have some NFC data written to it, the KBR1 will not bother with that data. It will only read the
serial number and type that out.

‘Danz:rous

a, eS

Win10 microchip implant login
with the KBR1 USB reader

Step 1) Simply plug in the KBR1 reader to a USB port on your computer.

Step 2) Bring up the Start menu and type sign to bring up Sign-in options under System
settings.

Step 3) Add an alternate sign in PIN code by tapping the Add button under the PIN section.
Step 4) Enter your current password to enable adding a new PIN.

Step 5) With the cursor in the New PIN box, then scan your chip to “type” the new PIN code
based on the chip’s serial number.

Step 6) Move the cursor to the Confirm PIN box and scan your chip again to again “type” the
serial number. The scan will be followed by a “carriage return”, also knows as what is typed when
you press the ENTER key. This means the PIN box will close as you have successfully added a
new PIN to your account.

Step 7) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen should ask for PIN code automatically,
not password. However if you are asked for a password, you will also be able to click a PIN code
icon to switch to PIN authentication. Scan your chip on the scanner and the serial number will be
typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow, automatically logging you in.

Logging in to Apple macOS

« macOs

Log into MacOS with a microchip implant and the KBR1

Step 1) Simply plug in the KBR1 reader to a USB port on your computer. On MacOS you
may be asked to confirm the type of keyboard connected, and the default selection should be
fine. It may also ask you to press some keys on the keyboard to verify your selection, but you can
just close this dialog window to move on.

Step 2) Bring up System Preferences and go to Users & Groups to access the Change
Password function.

Step 3) Bring up a text editor application you can use to capture the output of the KBR1
when you scan your 1S014443A compliant chip implant, then with the cursor in the text editor
window, scan your chip and the serial number of your chip implant will be “typed out” by the
KBR1 into the text editor window.

Step 4) Go back to the change password dialog window and enter your current password as
requested, then manually type the serial number output into the text editor into the New password
and Verify text boxes. You cannot copy and paste into these boxes, and your password is case
sensitive as well so the password you type must match exactly what was output into the text
editor.

Step 5) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen will ask for your password. Scan your
chip on the scanner and the serial number will be typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow,
automatically logging you in.

* Because MacOS does not offer an alternative PIN code style authentication option like we use
in the above Windows 10 example, you should be careful to remember your “new password” as
output by the KBR1 , just in case you find yourself without your KBR1 scanner and still
need to log in.

1S014443A chip, ACR122U , and Rohos software

The ACR122U is a PC/SC capable CCID reader that allows more low level commands to be
sent to the RFID chip it is scanning than the KBR1 does. The down side is that the reader
alone can’t do anything. It needs additional application software to do anything other than been
and show a green light on successful tag read. The upside though is that the ACR122U

reader can leverage commands and features interactions of the tags it interacts with.

Rohos Logon Key is software from rohos.com that allows some interesting authentication
options for Windows 10 and Mac OS, however the MacOS version does not support RFID like
the Windows version does.

Logging in to Windows 10 with Rohos

am Windows 10

Log into Win10 with microchip implant, ACR122U reader, and Rohos Logon Key

Step 1) Download and install Rohos Logon Key from https://rohos.com
Step 2) Run Rohos Logon Key and tap Setup Authentication Key

Step 3) Place your ISO14443A chip implant on the ACR122U reader so the light remains
green

Step 4) Enter your Windows 10 account password and hit enter

Step 5) Your key should now be enrolled. Now lock your screen or log out. Scan your chip on the
ACR122U reader and you should automatically be logged in.

If you are lucky enough to be able to change the locks in your door, then the process of
upgrading should be fairly simple. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I’m not familiar with
any electronic door locks that can read RFID chips and also fit retro overtop of an existing door
lock, which would be necessary for people who rent or are otherwise unable or not allowed to
change the locks in their door.

There are many different types and styles of door locks around the world. The image above
shows a US deadbolt lock. Luckily we have a dedicated community here on this forum that come
from all over the world. They have been diligently reporting results with various door locks, and
so there is a constantly updated compatibility matrix we all regularly contribute to that can help
you find a door lock that fits your door and which products it works with.

& Chip compatibility matrix - Google Sheets WIKIs

As the title suggests, We have a Google Sheets Spreadsheet compiled by, and for the DT
(and Vivokey) Forum members. It is a comprehensive, yet not an exhaustive list of products
and the DT / Vivokey products they are compatible with.
[Screenshot_20200708-204900_Sheets] [image] It is a living document, as we continue to

Accessing your car with a chip implant

Sorting out how to access and drive your car is, unfortunately, far less simple than home door
locks. Unless you drive a Tesla (covered below), some level of modification will always be
necessary for your car to achieve a full key replacement using a chip implant.

¢ Traditionally keyed vehicles

Your standard keyed vehicle will usually have some sort of active fob system, either physically
part of the key or as a separate device, which is used by pushbutton to lock and unlock your door
and disarm the alarm.

This keyfob will typically need to be hacked in some way to properly manipulate the door locks
and the alarm. In addition to the lock control fob, the physical key inserted into the ignition will
likely also have an RFID transponder inside of it which is read by the car’s ECU to disengage the
immobilizer. Without this transponder, if you had a key that could turn the ignition switch, the car
would still not start. Hacking this ignition key transponder in some way will also likely need to be
part of the solution.

Finally, the steering column typically requires a physical turn of a key to disengage the steering
wheel lock itself so you can drive. These locks can be mechanically disengaged, but it requires
complete disassembly of the steering column to get at this locking mechanism.

Getting these kinds of vehicles to work with chip implants is extremely involved and difficult.
Essentially you have to completely disable all anti-theft measures put in place by the vehicle
manufacturer and then hack the lock controls too. It’s seldom worth doing if you are not a car
mechanic yourself.

e “Keyless” vehicle systems

This term is misleading because you still need a keyfob, but the point is that these systems use
an active key fob device that constantly transmits.

When in range of the vehicle, the doors (and trunk or hatchback door) will engage small unlock
buttons you can press to unlock just be walking up with the fob in your pocket. Likewise you can
sit in the car with the fob in your pocket and simply press the start button.

On the plus side, you don’t have to hack your car at all to get this kind of system working with a
chip implant. You only have to get a spare keyfob and hack that! There are several ways to go
about this process, but the basic concept is that you will open the spare key fob and find where
the battery connects to the key. You will create a switch for this battery using an RFID reader so
that you scan your chip, the key fob gets power and the car “sees” the key fob is in range. Then
all the door buttons will work and you can drive the car. When you scan your chip again, the key
fob loses power and the car thinks the key fob has gone out of range.

Exactly how to do this has not been standardized or turned into a product yet, but there are
people on this forum that have experimented with just such a project. If you are interested in
exploring this option, post the make and model of your vehicle and indicate you'd like assistance
hacking your key fob. You are certain to get help from our amazing community here in no time.

e Tesla keycard access

If you drive a Tesla model 3, model Y, or the new 2021+ models of the S or X (and hopefully
Cybertruck, but we don’t know yet), then you should be able to access your car and drive away
using a keycard.

a

This is a special kind of passive RFID device called a Contactless Smart Card, or sometimes
called a Contactless Secure Element. What that means is that the chip inside this card doesn’t
just have a serial number and some memory for data storage, it is an actual small computer that
can run software called Java Card applications. Lucky for us, the Tesla keycard runs such a Java
Card application and it uses a special kind of encryption technology called public key encryption.

Also lucky for us, the application is extremely secure and cannot be hacked, however also does
not utilize (at the time of this writing) any authorization signature. The short story is, while the key
cards cannot be hacked to steal cars, you can register a non-Tesla RFID chip running the correct
software with your car and it will appear to be a key card to the Tesla vehicle.

There is currently only one kind of implantable RFID chip that can do this, and it’s called the
VivoKey Apex. There are a few different types of Apex products in development and those should
be released by the time you read this. Here are some relevant links.

e VivoKey Apex chips 501
e VivoKey Apex Ring 208
e Not A Keycard Application for Apex 97

Building your own access control solution

Part of the fun of hacking is making your own solutions. One of the ways we enable you to do
that easily is with our xAC v2 Access Controller. It is a special 125kHz reader with additional
memory and features on board that allow you to add chip IDs to a list of “authorized” chips, anda
relay on board that can trigger external events like open a garage door or special project box or
even a customized tool box 46 .

Your imagination is the limit!

Here are some videos that explain the xAC and an example of what's possible.

Copying access cards / fobs / badges to a chip implant
HDT Info M Primers

amal

This post will cover the steps to hopefully copy a card, fob, or badge you currently possess
(source chip) into a chip implant that supports cloning (target chip). | say “hopefully” because you
need a couple things to be right to make this happen.

Requirements
There are two things that are necessary for your source chip to be cloneable to a target chip.

e Your source chip needs to be a simple device with weak breakable security, or no security
features at all. Don’t worry, most access control systems use completely insecure chips that
can easily be read by anyone. This surprises some people, but it comes down to profit
margin for the security company and cost for the owners of the access system, so it should
not be that much of a surprise. Secure chips cost more, and therefore are not actually used
by many access systems.

Your source chip needs to have a compatible target chip. This simply means that we need a
target chip that is compatible with your source chip. Basically speaking, the programmable
target chip needs to be able to look like your source chip in every respect once the
programming (cloning) is done. Because chips with reprogrammable serial numbers (also
called UIDs) are not the norm, there are only a few types of source chips that can be cloned
to a target chip.

Basic steps to cloning

1. Identify if you have a card, fob, or badge (“source chip”) that can be cloned and determine if
a reprogrammable “target chip” exists which is compatible with your “source chip”

2. Purchase the tools and target chip implant, then perform the cloning procedure

Step 1) Identify the type of source chip you want to copy

There are two primary frequency families of passive RFID chips. There are LF (low frequency)
chips which operate on 125kHz, and HF (high frequency) chips which operate at 13.56MHz.
There is really only one type of HF chip that can be cloned, but many different types of simple LF
chips that can be. | cover the differences in this video!

So you want to clone your work badge, apartment fob, gym pass, etc. to a chip ...

Dnz:rous

lay; \ xs

Can | clone my card / fob
to a chip implant?

————.

Steps to identify your chip

¢ Try scanning the source chip with an app called Taginfo using an Android phone preferably.
The app does exist for iPhone on App Store , but iPhone has some serious limitations
when it comes to scanning chips that are not specifically used for sharing NFC data, and
typically chips used for access control do not also have NFC data on them.

If your source chip fails to scan with your NFC enabled smartphone, you may need a
Proxmark3 in order to identify the source chip. On the plus side, you will probably need
a Proxmark3 to do the actual cloning as well, so it’s a descent investment.

13.56MHz Mifare Classic 1k chips

In the HF family of 13.56MHz chips, the Mifare “Classic” 1K chip is really only kind of chip that
has weak security and more importantly has a compatible target chip that exists which can look
and read like a Mifare Classic 1k chip, and that target chip is called a “Magic Mifare 1k” chip. The
Magic Mifare 1k chip comes in a few different flavors but the ones we sell are called genta and
genz. The differences between these two “generations” of the Magic Mifare 1k chips has to how
data is copied to the chip, which | detail in this post;

125kHz common access chips

Most inexpensive access systems use one type of LF 125kHz chip or another because LF chips
tend to be simple, reliable, and very inexpensive. This also means almost all of them are not
secured in any way. Common names for these types of low frequency chips include EM41xx,
EM4200, HID 1326 ProxCard II, HID 1346 ProxCard III, Indala, Pyramid, Viking, AMV, ioProx,
Presco (and more).

The good news is that a company called Atmel makes a 125kHz chip called the T5577 which
is specifically designed to be able to emulate a huge variety of common 125kHz access chips
used by various access control systems. That means if you have an LF 125kHz source chip in a
card, fob, or badge, then it’s very likely you could clone that to any of our products that contain a
T5577 chip. Here’s a video about the T5577 that explains why it’s such a cool chip.

If you have a low frequency source chip that the Proxmark3 can identify, then you will want a
product that contains a T5577 chip such as the xEM » NExT , flexXEM , flexXMT :
or the Magic Ring.

done.

implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

What's so great about the flexM1 v2?

Basically, for many years the MF1ICS50 1k chip was used for all kinds of applications as a “secure chip” for everything from access control to stored
value cards, and used for making localized payments within closed systems like public transit and laundry services. However, its security mechanism
called “crypto1” is a simple, proprietary encryption mechanism that hardly has anything to do with modern cryptography. It has been broken for many
years now, but the sheer number of systems out there that still use it means the S50 1k chip will continue to be used by legacy systems around the
world for years to come. So now, you can crack the security on those cards and clone their content (including the 4 byte non-unique ID or NUID “serial
number”) to your flexM1!

WARNING /f you decide to purchase one of these units, be aware that “magic” chips come from Chinese grey market suppliers. Because the silicon IC
inside the flexM7 is not made by a large reputable RFID transponder company, proper functionality or performance is not guaranteed. That said, the
flexM1 still comes with our limited warranty protection.

Configuring the ZUID version with a Proxmark

Forum user Equipter wrote the following documentation.

USCUID - ZUID Guide

Features
© Can be used to Clone Mifare Classic 1k w/ 4Byte UID

© Genta Magic Mifare Classic backdoor commands
CUID/Gen2/Direct Write mode can be enabled
¢ Wake up SAK can be changed

© Configuration block for enabling/disabling features

GDM Configuration block

The GDM Configuration block is a hidden block that controls how the magic functions of the ZUID work.
The ZUID is a sibling of the USCUID chip and does not have the full suite of functions that the UCUID has and therefore not all options within the
configuration block are applicable.
Commands:
¢ hf mf gdmcfg - output current configuration block of tag

¢ hf mf gdmsetcfg - upload config block to tag

¢ hf mf gdmparsecfg - decode configuration from provided block, used to check you have set the right bytes to enable the desired
feature.
because we are using a ZUID, we add the --genia parameter to our GDM commands, this tells the proxmark to use the genla magic backdoor to
communicate with the GDM block.
to read out the current configuration on your ZUID run: hf mf gdmcfg --genla

below is the output of the default state of a ZUID.

to activate a function, you replace its bytes in the block with 54, because this is ZUID this only applies to CUID.
NOTE: genla cannot be deactivated but can be active at the same time as CUID

Example: Changing the Wake-Up SAK

it is unlikely that you will need to ever change the SAK but in the event that you do need to, it is controlled by the last byte of the GDM block, by
changing this byte you change the SAK. do not change the SAK unless you need to, it is a critical part of the wake-up process

Magic Gen1la

The Magic Genla command set are enabled by default on the ZUID, allowing you to interact with the implant in the same way as a traditional
xm1/flexm1.
The hf mf c* commands are for interacting with the backdoor into the chip, this allows you to perform functions without needing to
authenticate with the tag.
the key Magic Commands to know are:

© hf mf csetuid -u [UID] this command will change the UID of the tag and auto calculate the BCC xor of the uid for you, allowing you to

easily change the UID without modifying the rest of the tags memory

© hf mf cload -f [Dumpfile] this command uploads a dumpfile of a mifare classic into the tag, turning it into a 1-1 clone of the original

© hf mf cwipe - this will wipe the tag to a blank state, it will not damage the tag but it will erase any contents within it.

© hf mf cview - this allows you to view the full tag memory within the client

© hf mf csave -f [choose file name] - this allows you to save a dump of the contents of the tag
for all other c* commands run hf mf by itself and look for the hf mf c* command list

CUID

CUID also known as Direct Write or magic gen2 is by itself a type of magic card but also a mode the ZUID can be configured to have.

CUID Chips are able to change their UID by issuing a write command to block 0 (the manufacturer block, traditionally read only), this is the only
“Magic” function of CUID.

This can be done via hf mf wrbl --blk @ -d [newblock@] -k [key, default is FFFFFFFFFFFF] --force

It is incredibly important you write a valid block 0 to the card to ensure you do not brick it. With ZUID you are able to easily unbrick it with the
Gen! Magic commands but for standard CUID chips, an invalid block 0 will brick the tag.

Example: Change UID by block 0 write.

Sharing information with NFC enabled smartphones

Sharing information with NFC enabled smartphones

NFC or Near Field Communication is a narrow standard applied to specific kinds of passive RFID
chips. In other words, all “NFC chips” are simply RFID chips, but not all RFID chips comply with
the NFC standard. So when | say “NFC chip”, | just mean it’s an RFID chip that complies to the
NFC standard.

The benefit of NFC is that it guarantees a reliable way for passive NFC chips to communicate
data in a standardized way with NFC capable devices like smartphones and other NFC readers.
All RFID chips have a serial number which typically cannot be changed (but some can!), and
some chips have additional programmable memory blocks. This additional programmable
memory is where NFC chips store the data to be shared with NFC readers.

NFC technology basics

All RFID chips which comply with NFC standards operate on HF or High Frequency (13.56MHz).
This is an important detail to remember because we also have LF or Low Frequency (125kHz)
chips which cannot be read or scanned by NFC devices or smartphones. Finally, because not all
RFID chips are NFC compliant, we also have HF (13.56MHz) RFID chips which do not comply
with NFC standards, but can in some cases still be read by certain NFC capable smartphones.

Reading NFC chips

The great news is, you don’t need any special app on your phone to read NFC data from an NFC
chip, that is handled by the phone’s operating system. If you scan an NFC chip that has a
website link on it, your phone will ask if you want to open the link. It’s as easy as that!

Programming NFC chips

To program an NFC chip with data you want to share, there are a number of different smartphone
apps that can be used. Some popular options are TagWriter 319 and NFC Tools 299 . Both of
these apps can easily program your NFC chips with sharable data like website links, contact
information, plain text data, or even custom binary data and automation task triggers for apps like
Tasker 79 .

iphone

Popular NFC compliant chip implants

We have multiple chip implant products that are NFC compliant and can share data with
smartphones. | will list our most popular options below with short descriptions. If you have not
read the difference between x-series and flex products 136 , you might want to check that out
first, then come back to read about the products.

e xNT 149 - This is the original NFC implant, successfully crowdfunded in 2013. It is an entry
level, inexpensive NFC implant which has an unchangeable (read only) serial number and
can be programmed with a small amount of data (approx 873 bytes) good for sharing
website links, social media profiles, youtube videos, contact details, etc.

flexNT 135 - This is the flex version of the xNT 149 . It has the same NFC chip inside as the
XxNT 149 but performs better with NFC readers due to its shape and size.

NExT 235 - This is our next generation dual chip implant. It contains the same NFC chip as
the xNT 149 and flexNT 125 , however it also contains an additional T5577 46 chip inside
a single implant. The T5577 46 has no programmable user memory, only a serial number.
However, the advantage of the T5577 46 chip is that the serial number can be
programmed to emulate different types of common low frequency access cards, key fobs,
work badges, etc. using a special device called the Proxmark3 121 . To learn more about
that, check out this post about copying common cards and fobs 227 .

xSIID 448 - If you like to show off a bit of flash, the xSIID 448 might be what you're
interested in. This chip implant has a similar kind of NFC chip inside as the xNT 149 / NExT

235 . In addition, it has a connected LED that lights up when the chip is being read by a
reader. The LED comes in various colors too!

In fact, this forum has a whole collection of community members who like showing off their
blinkies.

A place to show off your xSIID 448 NFC + LED Implant Be aware that your xSIID 448 blinky
may not be visible for some time after installation due to blood surrounding the implant. It can
sometimes take days to a couple weeks for full brightness.

All of our NFC compliant products

While the products listed above are our more popular NFC compliant chip implants, we have
many NFC compliant products including wearables and other accessories. Here are all of our
NFC compliant products.

There are a few different combinations of chip type, reader, and software that can all work to get
you logged in to your computer quickly. | will explain the different approaches in detail below.

1S014443A chip and the KBR1

The easiest method to log into a computer is to use the KBR1 reader with an 1SO14443A.
compliant chip implant. The KBR1 is what is known as a “keyboard wedge” reader. It works
by reading the serial number of any 1S014443A chip and then “typing” that serial number as if it
were a keyboard device being typed on by a human. The KBR1 requires no special drivers
or software to operate, simply plug it in and most modern computer systems will recognize it as
an additional keyboard. Scan a chip and the serial number will be typed out into whatever
application is active at the time, including computer login password dialog boxes. The KBR1

will not read any user memory, so if your chip is 1S014443A and also NFC compliant, and you
have some NFC data written to it, the KBR1 will not bother with that data. It will only read the
serial number and type that out.

a, eS

Win10 microchip implant login
with the KBR1 USB reader

Step 1) Simply plug in the KBR1 reader to a USB port on your computer.

Step 2) Bring up the Start menu and type sign to bring up Sign-in options under System
settings.

Step 3) Add an alternate sign in PIN code by tapping the Add button under the PIN section.
Step 4) Enter your current password to enable adding a new PIN.

Step 5) With the cursor in the New PIN box, then scan your chip to “type” the new PIN code
based on the chip’s serial number.

Step 6) Move the cursor to the Confirm PIN box and scan your chip again to again “type” the
serial number. The scan will be followed by a “carriage return”, also knows as what is typed when
you press the ENTER key. This means the PIN box will close as you have successfully added a
new PIN to your account.

Step 7) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen should ask for PIN code automatically,
not password. However if you are asked for a password, you will also be able to click a PIN code
icon to switch to PIN authentication. Scan your chip on the scanner and the serial number will be
typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow, automatically logging you in.

Logging in to Apple macOS

« macOs

Log into MacOS with a microchip implant and the KBR1

Step 1) Simply plug in the KBR1 reader to a USB port on your computer. On MacOS you
may be asked to confirm the type of keyboard connected, and the default selection should be
fine. It may also ask you to press some keys on the keyboard to verify your selection, but you can
just close this dialog window to move on.

Step 2) Bring up System Preferences and go to Users & Groups to access the Change
Password function.

Step 3) Bring up a text editor application you can use to capture the output of the KBR1
when you scan your 1S014443A compliant chip implant, then with the cursor in the text editor
window, scan your chip and the serial number of your chip implant will be “typed out” by the
KBR1 into the text editor window.

Step 4) Go back to the change password dialog window and enter your current password as
requested, then manually type the serial number output into the text editor into the New password
and Verify text boxes. You cannot copy and paste into these boxes, and your password is case
sensitive as well so the password you type must match exactly what was output into the text
editor.

Step 5) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen will ask for your password. Scan your
chip on the scanner and the serial number will be typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow,
automatically logging you in.

* Because MacOS does not offer an alternative PIN code style authentication option like we use
in the above Windows 10 example, you should be careful to remember your “new password” as
output by the KBR1 , just in case you find yourself without your KBR1 scanner and still
need to log in.

1S014443A chip, ACR122U , and Rohos software

The ACR122U is a PC/SC capable CCID reader that allows more low level commands to be
sent to the RFID chip it is scanning than the KBR1 does. The down side is that the reader
alone can’t do anything. It needs additional application software to do anything other than been
and show a green light on successful tag read. The upside though is that the ACR122U

reader can leverage commands and features interactions of the tags it interacts with.

Rohos Logon Key is software from rohos.com that allows some interesting authentication
options for Windows 10 and Mac OS, however the MacOS version does not support RFID like
the Windows version does.

Logging in to Windows 10 with Rohos

am Windows 10

Log into Win10 with microchip implant, ACR122U reader, and Rohos Logon Key

Step 1) Download and install Rohos Logon Key from https://rohos.com
Step 2) Run Rohos Logon Key and tap Setup Authentication Key

Step 3) Place your ISO14443A chip implant on the ACR122U reader so the light remains
green

Step 4) Enter your Windows 10 account password and hit enter

Step 5) Your key should now be enrolled. Now lock your screen or log out. Scan your chip on the
ACR122U reader and you should automatically be logged in.

Accessing your home with a chip implant

One of the most frequently used doors you'll need to unlock is the door to your own home. This
post covers what it will take to set up your own home and / or car to be accessed using a chip

implant.

If you are lucky enough to be able to change the locks in your door, then the process of
upgrading should be fairly simple. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I’m not familiar with
any electronic door locks that can read RFID chips and also fit retro overtop of an existing door
lock, which would be necessary for people who rent or are otherwise unable or not allowed to
change the locks in their door.

There are many different types and styles of door locks around the world. The image above
shows a US deadbolt lock. Luckily we have a dedicated community here on this forum that come
from all over the world. They have been diligently reporting results with various door locks, and
so there is a constantly updated compatibility matrix we all regularly contribute to that can help
you find a door lock that fits your door and which products it works with.

& Chip compatibility matrix - Google Sheets WIKIs

As the title suggests, We have a Google Sheets Spreadsheet compiled by, and for the DT
(and Vivokey) Forum members. It is a comprehensive, yet not an exhaustive list of products
and the DT / Vivokey products they are compatible with.
[Screenshot_20200708-204900_Sheets] [image] It is a living document, as we continue to
add to and update as we go, Therefore, if you see an error, omission, please post a reply in

Accessing your car with a chip implant

Sorting out how to access and drive your car is, unfortunately, far less simple than home door
locks. Unless you drive a Tesla (covered below), some level of modification will always be
necessary for your car to achieve a full key replacement using a chip implant.

¢ Traditionally keyed vehicles

Your standard keyed vehicle will usually have some sort of active fob system, either physically
part of the key or as a separate device, which is used by pushbutton to lock and unlock your door
and disarm the alarm.

This keyfob will typically need to be hacked in some way to properly manipulate the door locks
and the alarm. In addition to the lock control fob, the physical key inserted into the ignition will
likely also have an RFID transponder inside of it which is read by the car’s ECU to disengage the
immobilizer. Without this transponder, if you had a key that could turn the ignition switch, the car
would still not start. Hacking this ignition key transponder in some way will also likely need to be
part of the solution.

Finally, the steering column typically requires a physical turn of a key to disengage the steering
wheel lock itself so you can drive. These locks can be mechanically disengaged, but it requires
complete disassembly of the steering column to get at this locking mechanism.

Getting these kinds of vehicles to work with chip implants is extremely involved and difficult.
Essentially you have to completely disable all anti-theft measures put in place by the vehicle
manufacturer and then hack the lock controls too. It’s seldom worth doing if you are not a car
mechanic yourself.

e “Keyless” vehicle systems

This term is misleading because you still need a keyfob, but the point is that these systems use
an active key fob device that constantly transmits.

When in range of the vehicle, the doors (and trunk or hatchback door) will engage small unlock
buttons you can press to unlock just be walking up with the fob in your pocket. Likewise you can
sit in the car with the fob in your pocket and simply press the start button.

On the plus side, you don’t have to hack your car at all to get this kind of system working with a
chip implant. You only have to get a spare keyfob and hack that! There are several ways to go
about this process, but the basic concept is that you will open the spare key fob and find where
the battery connects to the key. You will create a switch for this battery using an RFID reader so
that you scan your chip, the key fob gets power and the car “sees” the key fob is in range. Then
all the door buttons will work and you can drive the car. When you scan your chip again, the key
fob loses power and the car thinks the key fob has gone out of range.

Exactly how to do this has not been standardized or turned into a product yet, but there are
people on this forum that have experimented with just such a project. If you are interested in
exploring this option, post the make and model of your vehicle and indicate you'd like assistance
hacking your key fob. You are certain to get help from our amazing community here in no time.

e Tesla keycard access

If you drive a Tesla model 3, model Y, or the new 2021+ models of the S or X (and hopefully
Cybertruck, but we don’t know yet), then you should be able to access your car and drive away
using a keycard.

a

This is a special kind of passive RFID device called a Contactless Smart Card, or sometimes
called a Contactless Secure Element. What that means is that the chip inside this card doesn’t
just have a serial number and some memory for data storage, it is an actual small computer that
can run software called Java Card applications. Lucky for us, the Tesla keycard runs such a Java
Card application and it uses a special kind of encryption technology called public key encryption.

Also lucky for us, the application is extremely secure and cannot be hacked, however also does
not utilize (at the time of this writing) any authorization signature. The short story is, while the key
cards cannot be hacked to steal cars, you can register a non-Tesla RFID chip running the correct
software with your car and it will appear to be a key card to the Tesla vehicle.

There is currently only one kind of implantable RFID chip that can do this, and it’s called the
VivoKey Apex. There are a few different types of Apex products in development and those should
be released by the time you read this. Here are some relevant links.

e VivoKey Apex chips 501
e VivoKey Apex Ring 208
e Not A Keycard Application for Apex 97

Building your own access control solution

Part of the fun of hacking is making your own solutions. One of the ways we enable you to do
that easily is with our xAC v2 Access Controller. It is a special 125kHz reader with additional
memory and features on board that allow you to add chip IDs to a list of “authorized” chips, anda
relay on board that can trigger external events like open a garage door or special project box or
even a customized tool box 46 .

Your imagination is the limit!

Here are some videos that explain the xAC and an example of what's possible.

Introduction to the JavaCard Ecosystem



JavaCards are a subset of the devices known as Smartcards, i.e. small plastic cards or tokens which contains a microprocessor and a communication interface.

Even if you don't know it, chances are good you used a JavaCard today. Most SIM cards run on JavaCard, the chips inside modern credit cards and debit cards do as well, and there are even chips embedded in some passports which run JavaCard. Ever wondered where that ominous "3 billion devices run Java" tagline comes from? Well, now you know :^).

Compared to other microprocessors, JavaCards are actually pretty complex. They usually come with an operating system, a set of software libraries and even a security and permissions control system. However, most chips are rather limited in terms of storage and memory - think kilobytes instead of gigabytes.

Some chips come with a wireless NFC interface, some come with gold contacts (like on a SIM card), and some have both.

JavaCard (JC)



"JavaCard" is a set of standards and specifications to run software on embedded systems. If you are used to the Java ecosystem, many things will be familiar: the software is packaged into applets, which are then run in a Virtual Machine. This allows for portability of an applet across many cards.

The programming language used is a true subset of Java, however the available APIs are different, and special care has to be taken when managing memory. For example, special atomic data transfer functions are available to ensure data integrity.

JavaCard and the development SDKs are nowadays managed by Oracle Inc.

GlobalPlatform (GP)



The GlobalPlatform specifications are another set of industry standards, which primarily define interactions with the JavaCard - specifically the management and installation of applets.

Keys and Authentication



GP enforces authentication and code signatures (DAP Verification) during the applet installation. The card applet storage can only be modified if the correct card administration key is provided, or if the applets are properly signed. The flexSecure ships with the default GP development administration key 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f. You can change this key if you want to - but do not forget it, there is no way to recover the card once it is locked.

This key is additionally used to open a secure communication channel to the card, via which the applet data is transferred.

Although unusual, it is possible to internally communicate between applets on a card. It is also possible to segment the card memory and storage into multiple independent security domains, and then use e.g. a "high-security" one for payment applets. These partitions can use different keys, and/or use derived keys from a master key or certificate. This is how Fidesmo runs payment functionality next to signed third-party applets on the same card, while ensuring the integrity of the payment applet.

The whole signature and key derivation process is complex, and out of scope for this introduction.

Many vendors implement their own proprietary extensions on top of GP, e.g. for EMV payment applets or legacy emulation.

GlobalPlatformPro (GPP)



A good and open-source GP interfacing software is GlobalPlatformPro (GPP). Download the latest stable version of GPP from https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/releases . On Windows, you have the option to use the exe file, the jar file works on all operating systems.

If you use the jar version, download and install the latest version of the Java runtime from your package manager or e.g. the Oracle website.

The best user guide for GPP can be found in its repository readme file.

Java Card OpenPlatform (JCOP)



JCOP is an embedded operating system for secure elements, which implements the JavaCard and GlobalPlatform specifications. It is mainly developed by NXP, and used on their chips.

On some chips, JCOP might provide additional proprietary functionality. The version running on the flexSecure is JCOP4, which implements GP 2.2.1 and 2.3, and is compatible to the JC API 3.0.4 Classic and 3.0.5 Classic.

ISO 7816 and Personal Computer / Smart Card (PC/SC)



The ISO/IEC 7816 standard defines smart cards in general. Among things like physical characteristics or electrical connections, the most relevant section is part 4, which defines the data exchange protocol using APDUs (Application Defined Data Units).

The PC/SC industry standard defines a set of mechanisms and APIs for the usage of smart cards on host operating systems, like Linux and Windows. An open-source implementation for Linux is provided by pcsc-lite, Windows and OSX ship their own implementations. All these APIs implement the WinSCard interface.

Answer To Reset (ATR)



When a smartcard is reset / connected, it responds with a characteristic message, the ATR. This message contains information about data coding conventions, supported communication speeds, and much more. It can be used to identify cards of the same type and/or manufacturer. For example, pcsc-lite ships with a list of known ATRs, and displays a human-readable name for the one it recognizes.

Application Protocol Data Units (APDUs)



The communication with a smartcard is performed by sending command data buffers to the card, and receiving response buffers. These APDU buffers have to follow the ISO 7816 standard.

Each APDU response contains a response code, The most important one is 0x90 0x00, which signals a successful command.

Packages and Applets



JC applications are distributed in .cap (converted applet) files. These files contain (usually) one package. A package can be loaded onto a card using GP, where it will be placed into the embedded filesystem.

Application Identifiers (AIDs)



An application identifier (AID) is a hexadecimal string of numbers, which globally uniquely identifies an applet. Companies have to apply to get their AIDs registered, and in theory no one else should use these AIDs for anything else. This of it like a domain name in the internet, a list of known AIDs is linked below.

Applet Instances



After a package has been deployed, the next step is to create an applet instance from it. A package can contain multiple applets, and an applet can be instantiated more than once if needed. The package ID, applet ID and AID can be dynamically specified at the time of instantiation, or be read from preset values in the package metadata.

Usually, loading the package and instantiating the applet is done in one step. Some applets may require some additional installation configuration parameters, which can be passed as well.

Before any communication with an applet can happen, it has to be selected by using its AID. An applet can be marked as default, in which case it is always automatically selected after a card reset.

Instances are retained across card resets and power cycles, and so is their non-volatile data (e.g. private keys).

flexSecure vs. Apex Flex



Please read the Introduction to the JavaCard Ecosystem first, to understand the technical differences.

Target Audience



If you want an easy-to-use implant with an existing ecosystem, a mobile app-store and the potential payment functionality in the future, then the Apex Flex is for you.

If you want full offline control over your hardware and keys, the maximum possible storage and memory, and are not afraid of using the console and reading into the technical documentation, then the flexSecure is for you.

The NXP P71 Chip



The specification of the chip used in the flexSecure and Apex Flex (with a differing configuration, see below) is as follows:

Manufacturer: NXP Semiconductors
Series: SmartMX3 Secure and Flexible Microcontroller
Model: P71D321
Operating system: JCOP4
Software interface: SCP02 GlobalPlatform 2.2.1 and 2.3 / Java Card 3.0.4 Classic and 3.0.5 Classic
Variant: J3R200 (200KB EEPROM)
Package: MOB10 ultra-thin (chip: 5 mm * 5 mm, total: 5 mm * 8 mm, thickness: 0.1 mm) punched from 35 mm tape reels
Hardware interface: Contactless (NFC 13.56 MHz, ISO/IEC 14443 Type A) only
Capacitance: 56 pF
Configuration: "MIFARE Plus EV1 in classic mode 4K applet" removed, leaves >= 164K EEPROM, >= 4KB RAM usable (for details, see below)
GlobalPlatform key: 404142434445464748494a4b4c4d4e4f (default test key)
Supported algorithms: RSA 4096bits, AES, SHA1/SHA224/SHA256/SHA384/SHA512, 3DES(ECB,CBC), KOREAN SEED, ECC FP 160 bits to 521 bits
Storage and Memory



The P71 has a few hundreds kilobytes of ROM (read-only) memory. The contents of the ROM, as well as its layout is specified by the ROM mask. This ROM mask is applied by the card factory, according to the customers order. This process requires fabrication keys by NXP (or even a custom silicon die), which are highly protected and usually only provided to contracted partners and factories.

The P71 J3R200 has about 200 KB of EEPROM (re-writeable) nonvolatile flash memory. According to our manufacturer, the flexSecure has at least 164 KB of EEPROM available. The Mifare classic emulation applet was removed from the ROM mask, otherwise only about 99 KB flash would have been available.

Measurements show an available persistent (EEPROM) storage of at least 167736 bytes for the flexSecure.

The ROM is typically used for storing pre-deployed packages which will never change. The EEPROM then stores only the applet instances, as well as configuration data like e.g. secret keys. In our case, all packages are loaded during runtime into the EEPROM, and the ROM is pretty much unused expect for some cryptographic algorithms and the operating system.

The P71 J3R200 has about 8 KB of volatile RAM available. Some of that is used by the operating system and cryptographic algorithms. According to our manufacturer, at least 4 KB of RAM is available for applets on the flexSecure.

Measurements show a transient (RAM) storage size of at least 4115 / 4112 (reset / deselect) bytes for the flexSecure.

The Apex Flex uses either the J3R200 or the J3R180 chip, which one is unclear at the time of writing. They have the same base specs (besides the J3R180 having a 20 KB smaller EEPROM), and use a different ROM mask specified by Fidesmo. The ROM mask should contain the pre-loaded payment package, and the EEPROM additionally contains the instance of this payment applet. This takes quite a chunk of memory (allegedly about 100 KB). Information on these Fidesmo-deployed chips is scarce, maybe the payment package is stored in the EEPROM as well. In any case, the remaining amount of storage and memory is significantly smaller than on the flexSecure.

Measurements show an available persistent (EEPROM) storage of at least 84336 bytes, and a transient (RAM) storage size of at least 4054 / 4160 (reset / deselect) bytes for the Apex Flex.

Important Note concerning Lockout



The P71 includes a hardware functionality which physically bricks the chip after too many authentication failures, when using the wrong GlobalPlatform key. There is no way to recover the chip after that, it permanently turns into dead silicon. If you change your GlobalPlatformKey, be sure to made a backup of the key. Also make extra sure to always specify the correct key when using GlobalPlatformPro. By default (if no key is specified), the default test key (see above) is used. Also, do not remove the management applet package (A0000001515350), or security controller (A000000151000000). They are part of the operating system.

It is important to note, if you have an Apex Flex then you do not have the master key and you cannot change it. You can brick your Apex Flex by attempting to use GlobalPlatformPro to access it without the key. Do not attempt to access your Apex Flex using GPP or you will end up bricking it.

Apex Flex & Fidesmo AB



The Apex Flex uses a chip personalized by Fidesmo AB, a swedish company providing a set of services and APIs for managing, deploying, and communicating with smartcard applets across many devices. They provide a mobile app-store, which can be used to load new applets onto your smartcard. They also provide payment functionality on their cards, as well as backend connections to service providers.

Ecosystem Constraints



Loading a third-party applet onto a Fidesmo-deployed smartcard requires the applet to be signed by Fidesmo, as they keep the administrative keys to the cards private. This signing process requires a developer account and an internet connection to the Fidesmo signing servers. The signature ensures that third-party applets are only allowed to be deployed into the "low-security" domain, i.e. not the one where the payment code runs.

Fidesmo retains the right to refuse to sign any applet they do not want running on their card. In addition, they only allow AIDs starting with their registered AID, joined with your developer ID. This ensures that your AIDs don't collide with any others. In special cases, you might be able to reach an agreement with them to use a different AID.

The Fidesmo fdsm tool handles the signing process, and is able to interface GP to load and manage applets onto a card. GPP can only be used in a very limited amount, as the administrative key is kept by Fidesmo. On an empty card with administrative access, signatures are not enforced - unless you specifically configure a security domain and sign the applets using your own certificates.

Applet Availability



It should be said that Fidesmo provides a very valuable service, and that their partnership with VivoKey on the Apex Flex is a big win for everyone. For example, Fidesmo provides the mentioned mobile app store, which provides an easy way to discover and install applets onto the Apex Flex.

Typically companies will deploy their applets to a smart card and lock he chip down, creating a single application card (like payment cards, access badges, Tesla key cards, etc). Fidesmo brokers on-chip security in a way that makes it possible for 3rd parties to feel comfortable enough to allow their applets to be deployed and operate on-chip with other applets. More specifically, Fidesmo's management of the master key, review of applets before publication, and deployment of applets into separate security domains on-chip, does not allow end users the means to access or attempt to subvert or maliciously attack the applet code or data stored in memory. Without this arrangement, it would not be possible to deploy trusted applications from 3rd parties (like payment applets) in a multi-application environment.

The flexSecure uses an empty chip with administrative keys available, which has not been personalized by Fidesmo. Consequently, it can not interact with the Fidesmo services and app store. You have to source the packages you want to install by yourself somewhere on the internet, or to compile them from source. You also have to load them onto the card manually, everything has to be managed using GP / GPP, but any AID you want can be deployed in order to impersonate other tokens or cards.

Payments



It is unclear if and when the payment functionality of the Apex Flex will ever be active. Mastercard / Visa have some ideological issues supporting implants, so although the Fidesmo payment applet works great, it is unable to be tokenized (configured with payment account data) on the Apex Flex. The payment applet will be loaded on the chip, but won't be possible to use. The applet will lie dormant until Visa / Mastercard sort out their issues.

The flexSecure comes without a payment applet. Although there are payment applet implementations by Fidesmo and e.g. Mastercard available, the legal paperwork and security requirements (sectioned chips, private administrative keys) mean that the flexSecure cannot and will not be able to make payments.

JavaCard Development Setup



If you want to compile applets from source, you need to install a few requirements. These instructions are for Linux, but it should work on Windows as well (using Docker or maybe WSL, see below).

Local Development



You need to install a few software packages.

JavaCard Development Kit 3.0.4 from Oracle, or from the GitHub mirror.
Apache Ant from the website or your package manager.
Java Development Kit 8 from Oracle, or even better from OpenJDK, available via your package manager.

For Ubuntu, the packages are called ant and openjdk-8-jdk. You might have to switch to the JDK using update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-*/jre/bin/java.

I also recommend installing a few tools to interact with PCSC readers, e.g. opensc, pcscd, pcsc-tools, and python3-pyscard if you use Python.

JavaCard SDKs as Submodule



Some repositories include the JavaCard SDKs as a submodule. You can use either these submodules or your own download. Make sure to clone the repositories using git clone --recursive to clone the submodules as well, or make sure to initialize the submodule after cloning.

Testing and Emulation



You can emulate and debug your applet locally by simulating a PCSC reader and running your applet in a virtual environment. This requires you to use Linux.

Virtual Reader



Install pcscd, pcsc-tools, opensc and vsmartcard-vpcd from your package manager.

Make sure the virtual reader shows up when running pcsc_scan -r or opensc-tool -lr:

pcsc_scan -r

0: Virtual PCD 00 00
1: Virtual PCD 00 01
opensc-tool -l

# Detected readers (pcsc)
Nr.  Card  Features  Name
0    Yes             Virtual PCD 00 00
1    No              Virtual PCD 00 01
Applet Emulation



Clone jcardsim from https://github.com/DangerousThings/jcardsim using git. To emulate the compiled applet, run:

java -cp jcardsim-3.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar:TARGET com.licel.jcardsim.remote.VSmartCard CONFIG.cfg

Replace TARGET with the relative path to the directory containing the compiled class files of your applet, e.g. ./target. Replace CONFIG.cfg with the path to your jcardsim configuration file. This file looks like this:

com.licel.jcardsim.card.applet.0.AID=YOURAID
com.licel.jcardsim.card.applet.0.Class=your.main.ClassName
com.licel.jcardsim.card.ATR=YOURATR
com.licel.jcardsim.vsmartcard.host=localhost
com.licel.jcardsim.vsmartcard.port=35963

Replace YOURAID with the AID you want the applet to have, e.g. A0000005272001. Replace your.main.ClassName with the class name of the main class, e.g. com.vivokey.ykhmac.YkHMACApplet. Replace ATR with the answer to reset to emulate, e.g. 3B8D80018073C021C057597562694B6579F9; look at the pcsc-tools list or some online sources (see below) to find an appropriate ATR.

Initializing the Applet



Next, send the initial boot APDU to create the applet, using opensc-tool to send raw APDUs:

opensc-tool -r 'Virtual PCD 00 00' -s '80 b8 00 00 KK  PP  QQ QQ QQ ... 00 [RR SS SS SS ...] FF'

Replace KK with the amount of bytes after KK. Replace PP with the amount of QQ bytes. Replace QQ QQ QQ ... with the AID of the applet. If you want to pass initialization parameters, replace RR with the amount of SS bytes, and SS SS SS ... with the initialization data. Do not actually write the [ ] brackets, these just mean that the initialization section is optional. Example: 80 b8 00 00 0A 07 a0 00 00 05 27 20 01 00 FF.

Make sure the command was successful by watching for Received (SW1=0x90, SW2=0x00).

Using the Emulated Applet



From here on, the applet should behave like a hardware card running the applet. You have to specify the correct reader (Virtual PCD 00 00) to access it.

Jcardsim will print a log of all APDUs, which is very helpful for debugging. You can also attach an interactive debugger to the emulator, although exceptions from your applet code will be printed by Jcardsim by default.

To "eject" the card, just stop the Jcardsim process.

Docker Container



If you do not want to clutter your system, or don't have a compatible Linux system, you can use a pre-made Docker container for compilation. Install Docker, and use the image at https://hub.docker.com/r/vivokey/smartcard-ci . You can find the source Dockerfile at https://github.com/DangerousThings/smartcard-ci . This image is also used to compile the applets distributed via https://github.com/DangerousThings/flexSecure-applets/releases .

To run a command inside the Docker container:

docker run -it --rm -v SOURCES:/app/src:rw vivokey/smartcard-ci "command"

Replace SOURCES with the absolute path to your source code directory, and "command" with the command you want to run.

You can look at the compilation scripts in https://github.com/DangerousThings/flexSecure-applets for reference.

The container also contains the virtual smartcard emulator, as well as the Bats test runner. You can use that to run tests against emulated applets. Refer to the test scripts in the repository.

Sideloading



Use the GlobalPlatformPro tools (GPP) from https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/releases to load the compiled applets onto a card. Refer to the GPP documentation for details.

For Fidesmo-deployed cards, use the fdsm tool from https://github.com/fidesmo/fdsm/releases to sign and sideload your applet. Refer to the Fidesmo developer documentation for details.

Do not remove the management applet package (A0000001515350), or security controller (A000000151000000). They are part of the operating system.

Android Problems and Solutions



Android has some particularities concerning NFC.

FIDO requires Security Manager



FIDO keys are handled by a Google Services component, which is absent on FOSS (e.g. Lineage) Android builds. Use MicroG instead, which implements a security manager and FIDO adapter since version v0.2.25.223616 . I contributed a few patches to ensure smooth operation, make sure to use at least version v0.2.26.223616.

Maximum NFC Transceive Length



On some Android ROMS, the NFC driver is configured improperly, which limits the size of data packets that can be exchanged. FIDO2 requires very large packets if no chained fragmentation is used (~1KB).

To change the configuration, add the line

ISO_DEP_MAX_TRANSCEIVE=0xFEFF

to each of the files /vendor/etc/libnfc-nci.conf and /vendor/etc/libnfc-brcm.conf (and any other files you find like e.g. libnfc-nxp.conf).

This requires root access.

Google Services



The proprietary Google Services security manager does not implement support for FIDO2, only U2F (time of writing: October 2022). The FIDO2 applet is backwards-compatible to U2F.

OTP / OATH Applet Naming



Due to some historical decisions and industry conventions, the naming of the two-factor authentication applets is a bit confusing.

1. Rolling One-Time Passwords



This applet stores a list of user accounts and generates rolling 6-digit codes for each one.

The version distributed via the VivoKey Fidesmo store should also be compatible with the Yubico Authenticator programs.

Supported protocols: OATH-TOTP (RFC 6238) and OATH-HOTP (RFC 4226)
Yubico calls this OATH (see https://docs.yubico.com/software/yubikey/tools/ykman/OATH_Commands.html)
Repository: https://github.com/VivoKey/apex-totp
Documentation: https://github.com/DangerousThings/flexsecure-applets/blob/master/docs/applets/2-totp-hotp.md
Applet name: vivokey-otp.cap, AID: A0:00:00:05:27:21:01:01
2. Static Challenge-Response



This applet provides two key slots, which can be programmed with a static secret key.

Even though this applet implements the Yubico-compatible HMAC-SHA1 challenge-response protocol, it does not support other slot configurations such as static HOTP, NDEF, or YubiOTP. For HOTP, use the other applet.

Supported protocols: HMAC-SHA1 (RFC 2104)
Yubico calls this OTP (see https://docs.yubico.com/software/yubikey/tools/ykman/OTP_Commands.html, specifically chalresp)

Required JavaCard Algorithms



The applets distributed by VivoKey and contained in this repository require hardware support for a range of cryptographic algorithms.

Not all of these algorithms are hard requirements, some applets might provide fallbacks (e.g. for ALG_HMAC_SHA*) or limit certain functionality instead (e.g. PGP for generating large key sizes).

The scripts/algscan.sh script was used to generate this report.

Required JavaCard Algorithms



The applets distributed by VivoKey and contained in this repository require hardware support for a range of cryptographic algorithms.

Not all of these algorithms are hard requirements, some applets might provide fallbacks (e.g. for ALG_HMAC_SHA*) or limit certain functionality instead (e.g. PGP for generating large key sizes).

The scripts/algscan.sh script was used to generate this report.

More Information

The flexSecure is a subdermal contactless secure element enabling fully autonomous separation of your cryptographic keys and functions from
vulnerable general computing platforms such as your smartphone or computer. The ability to not only carry your OTP, PGP and other cryptographic
keys with you at all times, but also perform cryptographic functions in vivo (generate OTP codes, encrypt & decrypt data, etc.) without ever revealing
private keys to the NFC interface you are interacting with is a huge step forward for personal digital identity and data security.

Want a test card or to try before you commit to the implant? Check out the J3R180 card.

flexSecure Kit Contents

Your flexSecure kit comes with the following items.

 Pre-sterilized flexSecure implant in tyvek sterilization pouch
* Custom 4G (5mm) flex installation needle (unlubricated)
¢ 1 packet of sterile surgical needle lubricant

Use of your flexSecure

The flexSecure uses a SmartMX3 P71 chip from NXP. It comes with factory default master key set, and with ISD: A000000151000000 (OP_READY)
and the card manager applet PKG: A0000001515350 (LOADED) so it’s ready for use with GlobalPlatformPro. Full documentation is available via public
repository located at https://github.com/DangerousThings/flexsecure-applets/tree/master/docs.

flexSecure Applets

You are free to compile and load any applets you want of course, but we are maintaining a repository of open source applets and associated tools for
your convenience at https://github.com/DangerousThings/flexsecure-applets/. If you would rather have an easy to use app-store like experience to
deploy and manage your in vivo secure applications, check out Apex Flex.

Global Platform GUI

The price of the absolute freedom the flexSecure provides is that it isn’t at all friendly to use. If you're interested he
in one but don't have the time for the steep learning curve, give this a try. It gives you simple app and key
management, always offers you the latest versions, storage requirements reporting, and some other niceties.

As always, we suggest all operations done to your implant be first tried on a test card.

Check it out here.

WARNINGS

* The P71 chip in the flexSecure only allows a handful of incorrect master key attempts before permanently and irreversibly bricking itself. Changing
the master key from factory default is necessary for security, but losing the key has no recovery process. Bricking the P71 has no recovery process.
Proceed with caution.

+ The flexSecure is for advanced users. Compiling applets, deploying applets to the flexSecure, and using your flexSecure with various applications all
require some amount of mastery over the various domains involved. We do not offer direct support in any of these areas, however the community
forum will have a place for flexSecure discussion.

Professional installation notes

The flexSecure is approximately 8mm wide by 28mm long, with an average thickness of 0.4mm. Installation should always be done by a
professional.

¢ Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)
¢ Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only “semi-flexible”)

> Scalpel Procedure

> Needle Procedure

Important things to know about the flexSecure

— The biopolymer is ISO 10993 and USP Class IV tested and certified, however the final product has not been tested post-processing, meaning
material changes during processing could render the final product unsafe in some way.

— There is no “preferred” location for installation of a flex device. Customers are free to install a flex into any area of the body their installation
professional is comfortable with, as long as it is in the fascia layer between dermis and muscle tissue and not in an area of flexion or under a gripping
surface. Even though we use images which suggest installation above the second metacarpal of one of the fingers, it is not an ideal location for such
a device. Fingers are filled with tendons, nerve bundles, and very important things all packed into a very tight space. We urge you to think about easier
locations like the back of the hand or in the arm/wrist.

Reviews iCLASS® Seos 57

All categories
iCLASS® Seos access cards by HID include four subgroups, compatible with a number of

readers and classified accordingly. All groups are SIO enabled , high-security , and applicable
to both microprocessors and smartphones . Aug 2021

1. HID® iCLASS® Seos® 500x

e This is a high-frequency card which provides the option of a dual identity in a single
credential, enabling physical and logical access control. Users can apply the same card at
doors and for IT resources. It supports multiple applications as a part of a firewall
architecture, as well as a One-Time-Password (OTP) feature.

This card is most suitable for organizations in need of multi-application smart cards that
are interoperable between applications and environments . They are easily
programmable and come with a lifetime warranty, which means that they work best for
organizations that frequently have the need for managing access to logical and physical
information.

2. HID® iCLASS® Seos® + Prox Card 510x

e The card from this class supports the integration of former low-frequency (125 kHz) and
modern high-frequency access cards with Seos technology. The card provides dual identity
in a single credential, enabling physical and logical access control solutions. Users can
apply the same card at doors and for IT resources. It supports multiple applications as a
part of a firewall architecture, as well as a One-Time-Password (OTP) feature.

The Prox Card 510x is most suitable for organizations with already existing conventional
access control systems that are in need of a more advanced solution , but don’t like to
reinvent their access control from scratch.

3. HID® 520X iCLASS® Seos@/iCLASS®/Prox

e In line with the card label, these cards are multi-purpose and work with readers from the
following types: CLASS, iCLASS SE®, and Prox readers. They enable seamless integration
and secure private access via OTP. They are a three-in-one solution.

e The card is most suitable for organizations that need a comprehensive solution compatible
with multiple conventional access control systems. Organizations in need of upgrades
toward better security, but limited budgets , can use these cards while taking steps to
complete the full process.

4. HID® iCLASS® Seos®/iCLASS® 522X Card

e This is a dual-technology smart card that can operate with all iCLASS and iCLASS SE®
readers, secure access via mobile device, and managing multiple applications. It also
provides OTP access to a secure private network and can, therefore, be used for IT
resources.

e These dual-technology smart cards are most suited for organizations that need a single
solution for two technologies and undertake a step-by-step upgrade of traditional
physical access control systems in line with the budgeting possibilities.

iCLASS SE® Card 92

The card works with both high frequency and ultra-high frequency SlO-enabled credentials .
It has eight subtypes, each including specifications such as:

e Possibility to upgrade from a 125KHz Proximity to iCLASS SE (13.56 MHz)

e Versatile interoperability.

e Long-range parking and gate control.

e Dual technology (SIO-Enabled MIFARE Classic (13.56 MHz) credentials + 125 KHz
Proximity).

e Long-range parking and gate control with support for MIFARE® Classic applications.

e Open-standard compatible with multiple applications.

e Dual Technology (SIO-Enabled MIFARE DESFire EV1 (13.56 MHz) credentials + 125 KHz
Proximity)

This is the broadest range of HID smart cards, consequently suited for organizations that have
varied physical structure, environment, and climate, and convenient for both closed and
open spaces.

iCLASS® Card 110

This card is a high-frequency, highly-secure contactless smart card solution . It comes in
nine subtypes, each with the following specifications:

e Multi-technology card with iCLASS, HITAG1 and HITAG2 for migration to iCLASS SE.

e Direct image and thermal transfer access card.

e High durability 13.56 MHz contactless smart card.

e Possibility to upgrade from an iCLASS reader to a more advanced access control system
e 13.56 MHz iCLASS smart Card with 125 kHz HID Proximity.

e Magnetic stripe card with a contact smart chip, and a PVC or composite card body.

e With or without 125 kHz HID Proximity and an optional contact smart chip module.

e Proximity, magnetic stripe, contact smart chip card with a PVC or composite card body.

The card is most suited for organizations in need of versatile technologies on multiple locations
that are in the process of upgrading the existing access control system to a more current
solution, but still cannot use a single technology or one type of card for all departments or
locations.

Crescendo® Card 9

Crescendo cards are highly-secure, multi-technology cards for converged access to doors
and IT resources, available in six subtypes, many of which are developed to suffice the standards
of the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology and the PKI (Public Key
Infrastructure).

Each of the six subtypes comes with the following features:

1. HID® Crescendo® C1100 Series is an open card for Identity Assurance Solution. It can be
used on standalone systems and centrally managed. As a hybrid card it helps companies
work with PKI based authentication, digital signatures, and data encryption.

2. HID® Crescendo® C1150 Series is a contact-only, large memory, low power, high-
performance hybrid card for logical and physical access control, compatible with Microsoft
mini-driver based applications and HID’s Actividentity products. It provides standard-based
password protection, digital signatures, cryptography features based on symmetric and
asymmetric keys, personal information, and network access.

3. HID® Crescendo® C1300 Series is a dual interface card for advanced security
installations, compatible with the HID Seos vault and HID iCLASS SE ecosystem .

4. HID® Crescendo® 144K FIPS Series is a hybrid card with a U.S. NIST (National Institute
of Standards and Technology) FIPS 140-2 certification. It is compatible with Seos, iCLASS,
MIFARE Classic or MIFARE DESFire physical access solutions.

5. HID® Crescendo® PIV is a dual Interface card approved by the U.S. General Services
Administration as a FIPS 201 compliant PIV credential.

6. HID® Crescendo® Temporary Access Card is a PIV-like temporary access card
applicable for visitors and contractors to PIV-compliant organizations

HID Crescendo Series are most suited for government organizations or enterprises that must
work following U.S. federal security standards for physical and logical access control .
Since they contain multiple standard-based technologies and are made of durable materials, they
are convenient for employees who need to own several passwords and PINS.

HID Proximity Card 27
HID Proximity cards are 125kHz cards that come in the following six subtypes:

1. HID® Proximity 1351 ProxPass® II Active Tag is a long-range proximity tag for vehicles
that can be encoded with HID format and numbering system up to 37-bits in length. It can
be used in a six feet read range. It has a 2 to 5 years battery life.

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While our chip implants have undergone several quality checks during manufacture and have
been put through a battery of tests, nothing has been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body.
Your personal decision to purchase and ultimately the safe use of these devices is strictly your responsibility and at your own risk. The flexClass is
subdermal flex implant, conceived of and designed by community member @leumas95, is fully encapsulated in our custom biopolymer. It contains a
13.56MHz high frequency programmable HID standard (legacy) iClass transponder chip that allows you to *enroll it with your HID access system, or
use our Proxmark3 RFID research tool to clone / copy an HID iClass credential to it.

* Usually it's as simple as enrolling, but sometimes HID iClass systems will not enroll a blank chip and require cloning a legit card

Types of iClass chips

The flexClass chip works with iClass “legacy” or standard iClass systems, not with iClass SE or iClass SEOS.. though there may be some potential
tricks that can be used to get around these limitations. Those possibilities are being explored now, but have not been sorted out yet. There are a few
different types of iClass cards and chips out in the world, and identifying them is kind of a pain because the term iClass is not describing a specific
product, protocol, or standard. The HID company uses iClass strictly as a marketing term only, so figuring out what types of iClass systems use which
types of chips is not an easy task. If you have questions about compatibility with your system, post on the forum. We have members of the community
there that can help.

Using your flexClass implant

You have two ways of getting your flexClass working with your HID iClass standard system — enrollment and cloning.

+ Enrollment is the normal way one associates a new credential with an HID access control system. Typically it involves going to the security office to
get a new badge or fob or card, and the security admin takes a fresh card or badge out and “enrolls it”. This process basically looks like they just tap it
to a reader on the desk at the security office, but it is programming some secret stuff to the chip in the new credential and associating it with you (or
whoever the new credential is for) within the system. In theory, if you can convince the security admin, you should be able to tap your flexClass chip to
this reader during an enrollment action and it should all work fine. In some cases though, there are some specific technical reasons why the flexClass
may fail to enroll. If this is the case, then you will need to move on to option 2 — cloning.

* Cloning is the act of copying important identifying data used by the access control system to identify the credential holder from one physical
credential to another. To clone a legitimate enrolled iClass standard 13.56MHz credential to your flexClass, you will need to use a Proxmark3 tool and
some special commands. For more information on cloning HID iClass legacy / standard credentials, visit this forum post; https://
forum.dangerousthings.com/t/cloning-an-hid-iclass-credential-to-your-flexclass

Professional installation notes

The flexClass implant is approximately 7.5mm wide by 25mm long, with an average thickness of 0.4mm. Installation should always be done by a
professional.

¢ Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)
¢ Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only "semi-flexible")

> Scalpel Procedure

> Needle Procedure

Important things to know about flex implants

+ The biopolymer is ISO 10993 and USP Class VI tested and certified, however the final product has not been tested post-processing, meaning material
changes during processing could render the final product unsafe in some way.

+ There is no "preferred" location for installation of a flex device. Customers are free to install a flex into any area of the body their installation
professional is comfortable with, as long as it is in the fascia layer between dermis and muscle tissue and not in an area of flexion or under a gripping
surface. Even though we use images which suggest installation above the second metacarpal of one of the fingers, it is not an ideal location for such
a device. Fingers are filled with tendons, nerve bundles, and very important things all packed into a very tight space. We urge you to think about easier
locations like the back of the hand or in the arm/wrist.

The Apex line of implants (and their associated P71 chips) are one of the most versatile devices
Dangerous Announc... sold by Dangerous Things. They are one of the few chips that allows for installable applets,

. making them suitable for a variety of uses.
Reviews

All categories Applets enable the P71 chip to fully emulate an NFC Yubikey-style security device for
authentication. This guide covers installing, setting up, and using three specific applets that
enable Yubikey emulation. The applets can be installed on both an Apex chip as well as a
FlexSecure 18 or an inexpensive P71 card for testing and backup. Jul 2024

These three applets will enable you to:

e Generate standard TOTP authenticator codes directly on the Apex/P71

e Authenticate with the growing number of websites that support FIDO2 and U2F (Google,
Facebook, Microsoft and many others)

e Secure an encrypted password vault/database using a personalized secret that never
leaves the chip

Additionally, this guide utilizes a desktop PC for installing applets to both the Apex chip and a
P71 test card. This is done to make it easier to get an Apex set up before implantation since
desktop RFID transceivers offer better performance than most cell phones and output additional
logging and debugging info.

Much of the information is this guide comes from the excellent documentation 13 authored by
@StarGate01 .

Configuring the Applets

The FIDO2 and OTP applets do not need any configuration before they can be used, but the
HMAC/SHA‘1 applet must be provisioned with a secret. The instructions below are applicable
both to the Apex and naked P71 chips.

HMAC-SHA1 Configuration

The HMAC-SHA1 applet works by using a private key to generate a consistent response to a
challenge issued by another party. Typically the other party will generate a challenge during
enrollment/registration, send the challenge to the applet, then save the response. The challenge
is sometimes considered public information.

Before the HMAC-SHA‘1 applet can issue a response it must be configured with a secret. Once
the secret key is stored in the applet, it can never again be retrieved. It is important to decide if
you want to backup the secret and/or use the same secret for multiple devices. If you do
not back up the secret or configure a second device, there is no way to recover or recreate the
responses issued by the applet should something happen to the chip.

The secret should be entered as a 20-byte (40 character) hexadecimal string. The example
below shows how to easily generate a random secret in Python or Node.

The HMAC-SHA1 applet has two slots. If you only plan on configuring a single secret, use slot 1
since most applications will select it by default.

# python

import random

import hashlib

import string

random_str = ''.join(random.choices(string.printable, k=100))
hmac_secret = hashlib.sha512(random_str.encode()).hexdigest()[:40]
print (hmac_secret)

# node

const crypto = require('crypto');

randomStr = Array(100).fi11(0).map(x => Math.random().toString(36).charAt(2)).joi
hmac_secret = crypto.createHash('sha512') .update(randomStr) .digest('hex').slice(@
console. log(hmac_secret

Once you have a secret generated (and possibly backed up to a secure location), there are two
choices for using it to provision the applet.

yktool (desktop)

Download yktool.jar and install Java (any modern version will work).

# see help
java -jar yktool.jar --help

# provision the applet
echo '<secret>' | java -jar yktool.jar program hmac <1 or 2> -x -X

Apex Manager (Android)

1. Launch the app and scan your P71 with the HMAC-SHA‘1 applet installed
2. Tap on Key Slot 1 or 2

3. Either enter a 40-character hexadecimal key or generate one randomly
4. Tap Push New Key and scan your P71

HMAC-SHA1 Testing - Manual

Once you have provisioned the applet with a secret, you can use the yktool.jar utility to issue
a challenge and get the response.

Challenges should be issued as a 32-byte (64 character) hexadecimal string. Make sure to select
the correct slot when issuing the challenge. Place the P71 chip on the reader and run the
following

# generate a 32-byte challenge and print it to the console
python -c “import random; import string; print(''.join(random.choices(string.hexd

# issue the challenge
echo '<64_character_hex_challenge>' | java -jar .\yktool.jar hmac <slot_1_or_2> -

IMPORTANT: If you are backing up your HMAC-SHA‘1 secret by provisioning a 2nd device
(such as a P71 test card), make sure you get back identical responses from both chips. If
the responses differ, then you need to re-provision one or both chips with a new common secret.

Using the Applets

The three applets that were installed will collectively emulate the capabilities of a Yubikey
hardware device. While the standards used are mostly platform independent, Yubikey is the
largest provider of physical security tokens and has influenced how they have been set and
adopted. Because of this you will sometimes see Yubikey referred to in the context of a protocol
suite instead of an actual product.

HMAC-SHA1 and KeePassXC

tldr - KeePass vaults vaults can be secured with the HMAC-SHA‘1 applet, allowing to to encrypt
passwords and other sensitive information. Use KeePassXC on desktop, KeePass2Android on
Android, and Strongbox on iOS. On Android, you will also need to install the ykdroid intention. |
have not tested on iOS.

History and Compatibility

The HMAC-SHA1 protocol is not nearly as ubiquitous as either TOTP authenticators or FIDO2.
However, thanks to a code contribution by @StarGate, the applet can now work as a second
authentication mechanism for KeePassXC. The KeePass line of applications function as a secure
vault for passwords, payment accounts, and any other sensitive information. When combined
with a device like the Apex, a cloud-saved KeePass database can serve as a kind of infinite
extension of the secrets that can be secured with an implant.

KeePass vaults are stored as an encrypted database of entries, typically with a file extension of

.kdbx . The original KeePass was written on the Windows-centric .NET platform (C#) and while it
was later ported to other operating systems, it was difficult to update. KeePassX was a fork of
KeePass rewritten in C++ for better portability. However, the project was not well maintained and
has not been updated in many years. KeePassXC is the community version of KeePassX and is
actively maintained with semi-frequent releases. There is limited support for compatibility in the
database vault formats between the versions.

There is no direct KeePassXC mobile port, but there are free, open-source password managers
on both Android and iOS that can open KeePassXC databases. A common setup is to keep the
KeePass database file in the cloud, then read and write to it from multiple devices. The database
format supports change detection and limited merging, making shared use mostly seamless.

Challenge-Response Formats

Both KeePass and KeePassXC support the HMAC challenge-response Yubikey protocol.
However each implements it differently. KeePass uses the response to encrypt a sidecar file
which is then used as a key file to unlock the database. KeePassXC instead uses a portion of the
database’s random seed as the challenge, then incorporates the response (along with a
password) into the master encryption key. The key is changed each time the database is saved.

Databases that are secured using a YubiKey are not cross-compatible between KeePass
and KeePassXC. The method that KeePassXC uses is the more common, and is supported on
most operating systems, including mobile.

USB vs NFC

Using a Yubikey via USB generally has more support than using it via NFC, especially on
desktop.

KeePassXC gained support for NFC challenge-response in 2021 thanks to a PR by Stargate 3 .
KeePass2Android can use the ykdroid intention 11 , and Strongbox for iOS can work with NFC
challenge-responses 1 starting with iOS 13.3

Security and Recovery

All of the KeePassXC combatable applications listed in this guide are open source. The
KeePassXC desktop app completed a security audit in 2022. The auditor discovered “no major
problems” and recommended the use of the app for use. Both a summary and the full audit are
available on KeePassXC’s website.

KeePass2Android has not had any kind of formal security audit. The developer has been
responsive to reported security issues. However, he appears to be a single developer maintaining
the project in his free time. See this issue 1 for an example of a reported security issue and the
developer's response.

Strongbox is developed by a wider team of people but also has not had any formal security
audits. The development team has been responsive to security issues, and you can see a short
response to a security question 1 on Reddit.

KeePassXC implements limited protection against replay attacks by changing the challenge that
is issued on every save. This means that an intercept of the response between the applet and a
reader could only be used to open a database until the next time the file was saved and a new
challenge generated. However, if the database is versioned (Windows rollback, Google, Dropbox,
etc), then a replay attack would work on x number of previous instances depending on the
retention and rotation policy.

If the secret used to program the HMAC-SHA1 applet was backed up, it can be used to directly
open the database without needing to program the secret into another device.

KeePassXC has a standalone recovery utility available that will accept the raw secret as an input.
KeePass2Android has a “Password + Challenge-Response Secret (recovery mode)” option when
selecting the master key type. And Strongbox has a “Show Yubikey Secret Workaround Field”
option that can be enabled 2 .

If the secret that was used to program the HMAC-SHA‘1 applet is lost, there are no methods that |
know of (intended or otherwise) that would allow someone to generate the correct response or
gain access to the database.

Usage - KeePassXC

You must use the KBDX 4 format. When initially creating a database, select the “add additional
protection” option, then pick “Challenge Response’. Place the chip on the reader then click the
refresh button. If you have two secrets provisioned you will need to select the desired slot.

Asimilar process is used to open a database. You must place your chip on the reader and hit
refresh before you can select a slot. This can be awkward if your chip is in your mouse-wielding
hand. As a work-around you can press tab to focus the refresh icon, present your chip to the
reader, then press space to refresh the list and enter to open the database.

Anytime the database is saved you will be prompted to “present your Yubikey”. You only have a
couple of seconds to scan your chip before the request turns into an error message. If this
happens you will need to manually save using the ribbon button or file menu item.

Usage - KeePass2Android

Install the ykdroid intention from the Play Store or the GitHub repository. Android intentions are
a method for applications from different domains to communicate with each other. Once installed,
any application can use the net.pp3345.ykdroid.intent.action.CHALLENGE_RESPONSE to
send a challenge which will cause an NFC prompt to appear. The slot can be changed and
should be remembered. There does not appear to be any timeout once the prompt is triggered.
The intention will return the response as provided by the applet.

After starting the KeePass2Android app, select the “Password + Challenge-Response for
KeePass XC” option in the “Select master key type” dropdown, enter a password and select
Unlock. You will be prompted by ykroid to attach or swipe your Yubikey.

The Challenge-Response can only be used to fully unlock a database. At this time is cannot be
used for quick unlock.

Usage - Strongbox (iOS)

Help Requested: | do not have an iPhone and cannot test this functionality. If anyone would like
to try and and send me a short write-up I'll update this guide.

Authenticator (TOTP)

The TOTP authenticator protocol is probably the one that is most familiar to people when they
think about 2FA. The protocol is fairly simple and there are many implementations such as
Google, Microsoft, and Apple Authenticator.

Software-based TOTP authenticators work by using a shared secret along with the current time
to generate a 6 digit code. The authenticating party (e.g. a website) enrolls an authenticator
during sign up, then uses the shared secret along with the current time to validate that a provided
6-digit code was generated by a device with the same secret.

Hardware-based TOTP authenticators such as Yubikeys work the same way except that the
shared secret and code generation occur on secure hardware. The hardware generally makes
the secret write-only so once it is saved to the device, it can never be directly read again.

The OTP applet takes the place of hardware, storing the secret and generating codes. Note that
each provisioned secret will reduce the available space on the Apex/P71 chips. If you have many
services/websites you want to enroll, you may need to be selective about which ones you store
on the P71.

Both the Apex Manager and the Yubikey Authenticator smartphone apps can be used to enroll
and delete secrets and request and display codes. Which one you use comes down to personal
preference. There is no way to view or recover a secret once it has been enrolled. If you
want to have a backup you must either enroll two authenticators with the service at the same
time, or copy/backup the secret during enrollment (not recommended, as it defeats the purpose
of 2FA).

Yubikey Authenticator

Operation is straightforward. You can enroll new secrets either via QR code or manually. To
delete a credential first scan your chip, then tap on the credential to chose “remove”, and scan
your chip again. Long pressing on a credential will copy it to the clipboard.

Apex Manager

Operations are almost identical, except that you must scan your implant first, then select
Authenticator. The latest update to the app made it so that the credential codes will be generated
upon the initial scan and will be immediately visible on the Authenticator page. Touch behavior is
swapped from Yubikey. Use a long tap to edit or delete a credential, and a short tap to copy it to
the clipboard.

Testing OTP Codes

There are several ways to test the applet before actually using it on a service. If you just want to
make sure the applet is functioning, you can use FreeOTP - QR Code Generator to generate
your own QR code, scan it with either app, then scan your chip and ensure a 6-digit code is
generated.

If you want to test an actual login experience, use the Yubico Playground 10 which will let you
create a fake account, then sign into it using a number of options including TOTP codes. See the
Playground section later in this guide for more information.

FIDO2

The FIDO2 applet has support for both regular FIDO authentication as well as U2F (Universal
Two Factor). However, U2F requires OS-level support and is not implemented on some
combinations of browsers and operating systems.

Similar to TOTP codes, using a FIDO-based security key involves registering the device with an
authenticating party. However unlike TOTP-based authentication, the parties use public and
private keys to establish trust instead of a shared secret. There are also no code to generate or
enter. The full authentication flow happens during a single hardware-connected session. Where
TOTP uses a shared understanding of time to prevent replay attacks, FIDO primarily uses
counters.

FIDO credentials will take up storage on the P71 chip. There is currently no way to remove a
credential set once it has been stored on the chip other than uninstalling and reinstalling the
applet. Dangerous Things is hoping to add this functionality to the Apex Manager in the future.

Support

FIDO2 via NFC works very well on Windows with both Chrome and Firefox, and ok-ish on
Android. Support for FIDO2 is more limited on MacOS and iOS and may only work with Safari
(need more information).

Support on Linux using NFC is not natively supported in any of the browsers but can be hacked
around by using @Stargate’s FIDO2 PC/SC Bridge 2 which bridges an PC/SC NFC reader to a
virtual USB device that Chrome and Firefox can recognize.

Usage and Testing

The process for enrolling and using a FIDO2 hardware device is simple. During registration or
login your browser will ask you to present your device, and if successful you will be
authenticated.

Many of the larger cloud services such as Google, iCloud, Facebook, AWS, and Microsoft
support FIDO2 as a factor. The Yubico Playground 10 is a great way to test both enrollment and
usage. See the section below for more information.

Yubico Playground

Two of the three authentication applets/mechanics mentioned in this guide can be directly tested
in Yubico’s Playground 10 . However, the terminology used on their website can be confusing.

The playground allows you to create a demo account with a password, then attach as many
secondary authentication methods as you want. If you have multiple methods registered with
your demo account, you can hit “cancel” when prompted to present your security key to see the
other options.

Below is a list of the Yubico-named method and the P71 applet/method it corresponds to.

Yubico Applet/Technology
Security Keys FIDO2
Internal (Built-In Authenticators) not supported as an applet
Yubico One-Time Password not supported as an applet
Authenticator Application OTP (TOTP)
Recovery Codes nla

FIDO2

FIDO2 requires multiple layers between the card reader and the the demo website. It works well
on Windows + Firefox/Chome but YMMV with other combinations. There are also a lot of
approvals required from both Windows and the browser before a credential can be enrolled. The
process is self-explanatory once started.

When registering a FIDO2 device, there is an option that says “Enable passwordless login with
this key”. Selecting this will set up the P71 as a U2F device. U2F support among browsers and
operating systems is more limited compared to FIDO. If enabled, you will be required to set up a
PIN that you must then enter when authenticating with the card. The entire flow is somewhat
convoluted, especially when used on an implant that is not left in the field. You will have to tap
your P71 three times during enrollment. Once a PIN is set it will need to be used for all FIDO2
logins, not just passwordless ones.

Authenticator Application

You can use either the Yubikey Authenticator or the Apex Manager (or both). Generated codes
will be identical between each.

Recovery Codes

Try storing them in a KeePassXC database that is secured with the HMAC-SHA‘1 applet. Each
code can only be used once.

Tips and Tricks

Just some random things I’ve found useful or information that didn’t fit well elsewhere in the
guide.

Backup Strategies

¢ OTP Authenticator
© Enroll two devices at the same time
o While you can save the shared secret (either as a QR code or text), this is a horrible
security practice
e FIDO2
o Enroll two devices at the same time if allowed by the service
e¢ HMAC-SHA1
© Configure two devices with the same random secret, then throw it away (best)
© Save the secret somewhere secure

Best Practices
e Archive and document the specific versions of all applications and applets you use.

o Protect yourself from breaking changes and even entire repositories disappearing.
co Download mobile applications directly from repositories if available. Google Play or
Android might decide one day to remove these apps.

Test everything on a $15 P71 card before attempting to install and configure your Apex

o If you are in the US, shoot me a PM and | can send you a test card at cost via untracked
USPS

e Get an NFC repeater. Get lots of NFC repeaters. Put them everywhere

e Watch the free storage amount on your P71 (using the free-memory applet). You may
need to limit the number of OTP and FIDO2 credentials you store.

o KeePassXC can store OTP credentials. If you have a lot of credentials you can store the
critical ones directly on the OTP applet (such as your primary email), but keep the others
in a dedicated KeePass database. Use a different HMAC-SHA‘1 slot for a bit of extra
security.

KeePassXC
e Easier database unlocks if your chip is in your mouse-wielding hand

© open app and select database

© type in password

© press tab to focus the refresh icon

© present your hand to the reaper and wait for a beep
© press space to refresh the list

© press enter to unlock using the default slot

© remove your hand

e Temporarily remove the Challenge-Response second factor if you are going to be creating/
editing/deleting multiple entries.

o Database — Database Settings —- Remove Challenge Response

More Information

@ Introduction to the Apex Flex subdermal security key

VivoKey Apex

The key to your digital future.

Gd Voilube

The Apex Flex is a patent pending subdermal security key from VivoKey Technologies enabling always available, fully autonomous separation of
cryptographic functions from vulnerable general computing platforms such as your smartphone or computer. The ability to carry your OTP
authenticator, PGP, and other cryptographic keys, and perform cryptographic functions all in vivo (generate OTP codes, encrypt & decrypt data, etc.)
without ever revealing private keys to the NFC interface you are interacting with is a huge step forward for personal digital identity and data security.

Apex Flex Kit Contents
Your Apex Flex kit comes with the following items.

« Apex implant sealed in tyvek pouch and gas plasma sterilized
* Custom 4G (5mm) flex installation needle (unlubricated)
¢ 1 packet of sterile surgical needle lubricant

Apex Flex production

The Apex Flex implant is manufactured using small batch production in the USA. After inspection and cleaning, it is sealed in a Tyvek sterilization
pouch with a process indicator, then processed with gas plasma to sterilize. A lot label is placed on the pouch with processing and product details,
and the pouch is sealed inside a polymer pouch to help protect the sterilization pouch from contamination during storage and shipment.

Use of your Apex Flex

Once you have your Apex Flex installed, installed, grab your smartphone. Install the VivoKey Apex Manager app and the Fidesmo app. Open the
Fidesmo app, scan your Apex and you will see a list of supported applets you can deploy to your Apex. Applets are available from multiple vendors on
the Fidesmo platform, and VivoKey also publishes their own applets such as our OTP applet and NFC Sharing applet.

VivoKey Applets

VivoKey has created a number of applets to run on your Apex Flex! Here are some links;

* OTP Authenticator — This One Time Password applet replaces many two-factor Authenticator applications that store and generate OTP codes on the
phone itself, making them vulnerable to loss, theft, etc. With the OTP applet running on your Apex, you only have to install Apex Manager on ANY
smartphone to generate and display your OTP Authenticator codes, without risk of compromising your security.

+ Tesla Keycard — Once installed, you can register your Apex as a keycard with your Tesla 3, Y, X*, S* and use it to get in and drive away. *2027 or /ater
Mode! X and S only.

* NFC Share — You can easily share data with people with a simple tap of their smartphone to your Apex! You can share things like URLs, vCard digital
business cards, or even raw binary or text data. Available data sizes range from 1kB to 32kB!

Other applets like U2F, FIDO2, and PGP are also available! Check out the complete list at vivokey.com/apex.

— Fidesmo Pay is not supported for Apex Flex or any implants. Payment features are only enabled for EMV certified products
which have been approved by Mastercard and/or Visa payment networks. At this time, there are no payment networks that have authorized
implantable payment devices.

Professional installation notes

The Apex Flex is approximately 7.5mm wide by 28mm long, with an average thickness of 0.4mm. Installation should always be done by a
professional.

¢ Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)
¢ Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only “semi-flexible”)

Needle Procedure

e Incise skin using a 4g (5mm diameter) piercing needle, bevel side down
Carefully insert the needle to a depth of at least 35mm (video)
Be sure to lift the skin ahead of the needle’s point as you insert it
Slide flex device under skin with sterile gloves — no forceps or tools
Achieve complete hemostasis before applying bandaging
Use re-enforced butterfly bandage or dermal strips to pull wound closed
Apply transparent film (tegaderm) dressing overtop the dermal strips
While hemostasis is maintained, do not remove bandaging for 7-10 days

> Scalpel Procedure

Important things to know about Flex devices

+ The biopolymer is ISO 10993 and USP Class IV tested and certified, however the final product has not been tested post-processing, meaning material
changes during processing could render the final product unsafe in some way.

+ There is no “preferred” location for installation of a flex device. Customers are free to install a flex into any area of the body their installation
professional is comfortable with, as long as it is in the fascia layer between dermis and muscle tissue and not in an area of flexion or under a gripping
surface. However, the side or edge of the hand is not recommended due to increased tension in that location. Work with your professional to
determine the best, safest location for your flex device.

flexMN (Magic NTAG + T5577)

The flexMN is a flex form factor Magic NTAG chip that can be programmed with a
Proxmark3 to emulate several types of Ultralight and NTAG chips! It also contains a
T5577 125khz emulator chip to handle emulation of the more common lower
frequency cards, badges, and keyfobs. Working together, the flexMN is one of the
most powerful and reconfigurable transponder implants available today!

| Standard (no LEDs) v| © Clear

More Details

This kit definitely contains dangerous things. The flexMN transponder has not been tested or certified by any regulatory agency for
implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The flexMN is a flex combination of a Magic NTAG chip and the T5577 chip. The Magic NTAG is a new kind of NFC chip emulator that is capable of
emulating a huge number of NFC chip types in the Ultralight and NTAG family of tags. Now you can fully program the ID (serial number) and
application memory in both IS014443A and 125kHz chips a single implantable device with excellent performance and optional blinky lights too!

Professional installation notes

Installation of a flexMN device should always be done by a professional. We do not presume to know better than your professional installer what the
correct installation method for your body and desired implant location might be. Always defer to your installation professional's opinion on placement
and installation procedure.

¢ Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)

¢ Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only “semi-flexible”)

¢ The flexMN’s construction gives the final product a slight warping effect. This can be used to your advantage by encouraging the flexMN to
conform more easily to modest curves than a perfectly flat device.

Blinkies

If you choose to get a version with “blinkies”, there will be two LED modules, one on either side of the Magic NTAG chip. This is an example of a deep
blue LED color.

Campaign

Because of the cost and effort required to obtain the Magic NTAG chips to make the flexMN, we are choosing to make the flexMN in batches based on
campaigns run periodically throughout the year. There is no target goal, just a time window during which backers buy into the batch. After the window
closes, we stop selling the flexMN and concentrate on production.

The easiest method to log into a computer is to use the KBR1 reader with an 1SO14443A.
compliant chip implant. The KBR1 is what is known as a “keyboard wedge” reader. It works
by reading the serial number of any 1S014443A chip and then “typing” that serial number as if it
were a keyboard device being typed on by a human. The KBR1 requires no special drivers
or software to operate, simply plug it in and most modern computer systems will recognize it as
an additional keyboard. Scan a chip and the serial number will be typed out into whatever
application is active at the time, including computer login password dialog boxes. The KBR1

will not read any user memory, so if your chip is 1S014443A and also NFC compliant, and you
have some NFC data written to it, the KBR1 will not bother with that data. It will only read the
serial number and type that out.

window, scan your chip and the serial number of your chip implant will be “typed out” by the
KBR1 into the text editor window.

Step 4) Go back to the change password dialog window and enter your current password as
requested, then manually type the serial number output into the text editor into the New password
and Verify text boxes. You cannot copy and paste into these boxes, and your password is case
sensitive as well so the password you type must match exactly what was output into the text
editor.

Step 5) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen will ask for your password. Scan your
chip on the scanner and the serial number will be typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow,
automatically logging you in.

* Because MacOS does not offer an alternative PIN code style authentication option like we use
in the above Windows 10 example, you should be careful to remember your “new password” as
output by the KBR1 , just in case you find yourself without your KBR1 scanner and still
need to log in.

1S014443A chip, ACR122U , and Rohos software

The ACR122U is a PC/SC capable CCID reader that allows more low level commands to be
sent to the RFID chip it is scanning than the KBR1 does. The down side is that the reader
alone can’t do anything. It needs additional application software to do anything other than been
and show a green light on successful tag read. The upside though is that the ACR122U

reader can leverage commands and features interactions of the tags it interacts with.

Rohos Logon Key is software from rohos.com that allows some interesting authentication
options for Windows 10 and Mac OS, however the MacOS version does not support RFID like
the Windows version does.

Logging in to Windows 10 with Rohos

am Windows 10

Log into Win10 with microchip implant, ACR122U reader, and Rohos Logon Key

Step 1) Download and install Rohos Logon Key from https://rohos.com
Step 2) Run Rohos Logon Key and tap Setup Authentication Key

Step 3) Place your ISO14443A chip implant on the ACR122U reader so the light remains
green

Step 4) Enter your Windows 10 account password and hit enter

Step 5) Your key should now be enrolled. Now lock your screen or log out. Scan your chip on the
ACR122U reader and you should automatically be logged in.

If you are lucky enough to be able to change the locks in your door, then the process of
upgrading should be fairly simple. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I’m not familiar with
any electronic door locks that can read RFID chips and also fit retro overtop of an existing door
lock, which would be necessary for people who rent or are otherwise unable or not allowed to
change the locks in their door.

There are many different types and styles of door locks around the world. The image above
shows a US deadbolt lock. Luckily we have a dedicated community here on this forum that come
from all over the world. They have been diligently reporting results with various door locks, and
so there is a constantly updated compatibility matrix we all regularly contribute to that can help
you find a door lock that fits your door and which products it works with.

& Chip compatibility matrix - Google Sheets WIKIs

As the title suggests, We have a Google Sheets Spreadsheet compiled by, and for the DT
(and Vivokey) Forum members. It is a comprehensive, yet not an exhaustive list of products
and the DT / Vivokey products they are compatible with.
[Screenshot_20200708-204900_Sheets] [image] It is a living document, as we continue to
add to and update as we go, Therefore, if you see an error, omission, please post a reply in
this thread below. The more information you provide the easier it will make it fo...

Accessing your car with a chip implant

Sorting out how to access and drive your car is, unfortunately, far less simple than home door
locks. Unless you drive a Tesla (covered below), some level of modification will always be
necessary for your car to achieve a full key replacement using a chip implant.

¢ Traditionally keyed vehicles

Your standard keyed vehicle will usually have some sort of active fob system, either physically
part of the key or as a separate device, which is used by pushbutton to lock and unlock your door
and disarm the alarm.

This keyfob will typically need to be hacked in some way to properly manipulate the door locks
and the alarm. In addition to the lock control fob, the physical key inserted into the ignition will
likely also have an RFID transponder inside of it which is read by the car’s ECU to disengage the
immobilizer. Without this transponder, if you had a key that could turn the ignition switch, the car
would still not start. Hacking this ignition key transponder in some way will also likely need to be
part of the solution.

Finally, the steering column typically requires a physical turn of a key to disengage the steering
wheel lock itself so you can drive. These locks can be mechanically disengaged, but it requires
complete disassembly of the steering column to get at this locking mechanism.

Getting these kinds of vehicles to work with chip implants is extremely involved and difficult.
Essentially you have to completely disable all anti-theft measures put in place by the vehicle
manufacturer and then hack the lock controls too. It’s seldom worth doing if you are not a car
mechanic yourself.

e “Keyless” vehicle systems

This term is misleading because you still need a keyfob, but the point is that these systems use
an active key fob device that constantly transmits.

When in range of the vehicle, the doors (and trunk or hatchback door) will engage small unlock
buttons you can press to unlock just be walking up with the fob in your pocket. Likewise you can
sit in the car with the fob in your pocket and simply press the start button.

On the plus side, you don’t have to hack your car at all to get this kind of system working with a
chip implant. You only have to get a spare keyfob and hack that! There are several ways to go
about this process, but the basic concept is that you will open the spare key fob and find where
the battery connects to the key. You will create a switch for this battery using an RFID reader so
that you scan your chip, the key fob gets power and the car “sees” the key fob is in range. Then
all the door buttons will work and you can drive the car. When you scan your chip again, the key
fob loses power and the car thinks the key fob has gone out of range.

Exactly how to do this has not been standardized or turned into a product yet, but there are
people on this forum that have experimented with just such a project. If you are interested in
exploring this option, post the make and model of your vehicle and indicate you'd like assistance
hacking your key fob. You are certain to get help from our amazing community here in no time.

e Tesla keycard access

If you drive a Tesla model 3, model Y, or the new 2021+ models of the S or X (and hopefully
Cybertruck, but we don’t know yet), then you should be able to access your car and drive away
using a keycard.

re

This is a special kind of passive RFID device called a Contactless Smart Card, or sometimes
called a Contactless Secure Element. What that means is that the chip inside this card doesn’t
just have a serial number and some memory for data storage, it is an actual small computer that
can run software called Java Card applications. Lucky for us, the Tesla keycard runs such a Java
Card application and it uses a special kind of encryption technology called public key encryption.

Also lucky for us, the application is extremely secure and cannot be hacked, however also does
not utilize (at the time of this writing) any authorization signature. The short story is, while the key
cards cannot be hacked to steal cars, you can register a non-Tesla RFID chip running the correct
software with your car and it will appear to be a key card to the Tesla vehicle.

There is currently only one kind of implantable RFID chip that can do this, and it’s called the
VivoKey Apex. There are a few different types of Apex products in development and those should
be released by the time you read this. Here are some relevant links.

e VivoKey Apex chips 501
e VivoKey Apex Ring 208
e Not A Keycard Application for Apex 97

Building your own access control solution

Part of the fun of hacking is making your own solutions. One of the ways we enable you to do
that easily is with our xAC v2 Access Controller. It is a special 125kHz reader with additional
memory and features on board that allow you to add chip IDs to a list of “authorized” chips, anda
relay on board that can trigger external events like open a garage door or special project box or
even a customized tool box 46 .

Your imagination is the limit!

Here are some videos that explain the xAC and an example of what's possible.

This post will cover the steps to hopefully copy a card, fob, or badge you currently possess
(source chip) into a chip implant that supports cloning (target chip). | say “hopefully” because you

need a couple things to be right to make this happen.
Projects
Lounge Requirements
Dangerous Announc... There are two things that are necessary for your source chip to be cloneable to a target chip.
Reviews ¢ Your source chip needs to be a simple device with weak breakable security, or no security
All categories features at all. Don’t worry, most access control systems use completely insecure chips that

can easily be read by anyone. This surprises some people, but it comes down to profit
margin for the security company and cost for the owners of the access system, so it should
not be that much of a surprise. Secure chips cost more, and therefore are not actually used
by many access systems.

Your source chip needs to have a compatible target chip. This simply means that we need a
target chip that is compatible with your source chip. Basically speaking, the programmable
target chip needs to be able to look like your source chip in every respect once the
programming (cloning) is done. Because chips with reprogrammable serial numbers (also
called UIDs) are not the norm, there are only a few types of source chips that can be cloned
to a target chip.

Basic steps to cloning

1. Identify if you have a card, fob, or badge (“source chip”) that can be cloned and determine if
a reprogrammable “target chip” exists which is compatible with your “source chip”

2. Purchase the tools and target chip implant, then perform the cloning procedure

Step 1) Identify the type of source chip you want to copy

There are two primary frequency families of passive RFID chips. There are LF (low frequency)
chips which operate on 125kHz, and HF (high frequency) chips which operate at 13.56MHz.
There is really only one type of HF chip that can be cloned, but many different types of simple LF
chips that can be. | cover the differences in this video!

So you want to clone your work badge, apartment fob, gym pass, etc. to a chip .

Dnz:rous

lay; \ xs

Can | clone my card / fob
to a chip implant?

————.

Steps to identify your chip

¢ Try scanning the source chip with an app called Taginfo using an Android phone preferably.
The app does exist for iPhone on App Store , but iPhone has some serious limitations
when it comes to scanning chips that are not specifically used for sharing NFC data, and
typically chips used for access control do not also have NFC data on them.

If your source chip fails to scan with your NFC enabled smartphone, you may need a
Proxmark3 in order to identify the source chip. On the plus side, you will probably need
a Proxmark3 to do the actual cloning as well, so it’s a descent investment.

13.56MHz Mifare Classic 1k chips

In the HF family of 13.56MHz chips, the Mifare “Classic” 1K chip is really only kind of chip that
has weak security and more importantly has a compatible target chip that exists which can look
and read like a Mifare Classic 1k chip, and that target chip is called a “Magic Mifare 1k” chip. The
Magic Mifare 1k chip comes in a few different flavors but the ones we sell are called genta and
genz. The differences between these two “generations” of the Magic Mifare 1k chips has to how
data is copied to the chip, which | detail in this post;

0 "magic" Mifare chips DT Info

The Mifare “classic” S50 1k chip? For many years the Mifare MF1!CS50 1k chip was used for
all kinds of applications as a “secure chip” for everything from access control to stored value
cards, and used for making localized payments within closed systems like public transit and
laundry services. However, it uses a security mechanism called “crypto1” which is a simple,
proprietary encryption mechanism that hardly has anything to do with modern cryptography. It
has been broken for many years now, b...

125kHz common access chips

Most inexpensive access systems use one type of LF 125kHz chip or another because LF chips
tend to be simple, reliable, and very inexpensive. This also means almost all of them are not
secured in any way. Common names for these types of low frequency chips include EM41xx,
EM4200, HID 1326 ProxCard II, HID 1346 ProxCard III, Indala, Pyramid, Viking, AMV, ioProx,
Presco (and more).

The good news is that a company called Atmel makes a 125kHz chip called the T5577 which
is specifically designed to be able to emulate a huge variety of common 125kHz access chips
used by various access control systems. That means if you have an LF 125kHz source chip in a
card, fob, or badge, then it’s very likely you could clone that to any of our products that contain a
T5577 chip. Here’s a video about the T5577 that explains why it’s such a cool chip.

If you have a low frequency source chip that the Proxmark3 can identify, then you will want a
product that contains a T5577 chip such as the xEM » NExT , flexXEM , flexXMT :
or the Magic Ring.

If you have a source chip that the Proxmark3 can recognize with an LF scan, and supports a
clone option within the command menu system for that type of LF chip, then you should be able
to clone it to a product with a T5577 chip. Check out this video for examples of how this is
done.

can fully program the ID (serial number) and application memory in both IS014443A and 125kHz chips a single implantable device with excellent
performance and blinky lights too!

What can this chip implant do?

* Copy other LF and HF chip IDs to this chip
* Some types of access control applications
* Scan this chip implant to log into your computer

What this chip implant can't do

* Share data with NFC enabled smartphones

* Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
* Can't make payments with this chip implant

* Chip implants can't be used for GPS or tracking

Professional installation notes

Installation of a flexMT device should always be done by a professional. We do not presume to know better than your professional installer what the
correct installation method for your body and desired implant location might be. Always defer to your installation professional's opinion on placement
and installation procedure.

¢ Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)

¢ Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only “semi-flexible”)

¢ The flexMT’s construction gives the final product a slight warping effect. This can be used to your advantage by encouraging the flexMT to
conform more easily to modest curves than a perfectly flat device.

For more information about the Magic 1k genta chip inside the flexMT, please read the x1 product page. For more information about the T5577
emulator chip inside the flexMT, please watch this video.

flexNExT (NTAG216 + T5577)

The flexNExT is a monster built for performance, and a little bit of flash @

0.4mm thin biopolymer, 41mm total diameter

35mm NTAG216 13.56MHz NFC Type 2 ISO 14443A inlay
NTAG216 has 2.25" (57mm) range with ACR122U

15mm T5577 125kHz LF emulator chip

2.75" (70mm) range with T5577 and RedBee LF reader

read why here

More Details

This kit definitely contains dangerous things. The flexNExT transponder has not been tested or certified by any regulatory agency for
implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The flexNExT is a jumbo size flex version of our easily injectable 2mm diameter NExT dual frequency chip implant. It has the same NTAG216 and
T5577 chips inside, only super sized to drastically improve performance... and we can put some blinky lights on too.

IN Introduction to the flexNExT

Professional installation notes

Installation of a flexNExT device should always be done by a professional. We do not presume to know better than your professional installer what
the correct installation method for your body and desired implant location might be. Always defer to your installation professional's opinion on
placement and installation procedure.

¢ Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)
¢ Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only “semi-flexible”)

Important Things To Know

Please expand the sections below to read up on things like performance expectations, return policy, installation procedure, etc.

Ww NTAG216 Security

The NTAG216 was designed for use in more typical NFC applications such as smart posters, labels, and other disposable use cases where the
memory contents would typically be written and then locked so it could not be changed. This is done using built-in “lock bytes” which are OTP
(one time programmable). That means that once the lock bytes are turned on to protect memory blocks, they can never be unlocked. Once any
memory block is locked, it will forever be read-only, which is not ideal for the flexNExT. Many NFC applications offer ways to “lock” or “protect”
your tag, which will end up locking the tag read-only. Because of this, we have disabled the ability to change or set the lock bits in the
flexNExT’s NTAG216 chip.

Before disabling the lock bytes however, there is one page of user memory we do lock down as read-only. That is the CC or Capability Container,
located in memory page 03. This page of 4 bytes is required to have a specific format of data so the tag can be recognized and used as an NFC.
Type 2 tag. This memory page is also special in that the data stored there uses OTP bits, or “One Time Programmable” bits, meaning once a bit is
flipped from 0 to 1, it cannot be flipped back to 0. It is critical that this memory page be locked as read-only so a malicious attacker can’t mess up
your Capability Container, thus ruining the chip for use as an NFC compliant transponder. We set lock bytes to mark the Capability Container as
read-only, then we disable the lock bytes so no other memory pages can be permanently set as read-only.

In addition to lock bytes, the NTAG216 offers a 32bit password protection function. It can be used to password-protect just writing to or both
reading from and writing to the user memory space of the NTAG216 chip. Regardless of what some NFC smartphone apps indicate, it is not
possible to remove or disable the password. It is only possible to set the password to the default hexadecimal value of OxFF OxFF OxFF OxFF. If the
password is set to the default value, then anyone could easily authenticate, change the password, then write data or change protection options for
your tag, and change the password to some unknown value. Because it is also possible to protect memory blocks from unauthenticated reads
using a password, this could make the tag completely useless by not allowing any memory blocks to even be read. We set a default password
value of Ox4E 0x45 0x78 0x54 or NEXT, but strongly suggest you change it after installation.

Finally, many of the critical configuration bytes used by the NTAG216 chip are stored in the last few memory pages of the tag. This means that it
may be possible for an NFC application that does not properly detect or honor the flexNExT’s NTAG216 chip memory schema to accidentally
attempt to write binary or NDEF record data (the data you're trying to store on the tag) overtop of the configuration bytes. For example, if the data
you are attempting to write is longer than the user memory blocks available, the remainder of the data might be written overtop of configuration
bytes, which contain settings that are potentially dangerous to modify such as the config lock byte. It is not possible to disable the configuration
lock byte, so accidentally writing to that byte could result in your configuration being irreversibly locked. We password-protect the configuration
bytes from being able to be written to or updated using the password feature of the NTAG216 chip. Overall, the flexNExT leaves the factory with
the entire user memory space accessible and writable, while at the same time the configuration bytes and password values at the bottom end of
the NTAG216 chip's memory space are protected.

Once your flexNExT is installed, you'll be able to use any NFC smartphone app to write data to the tag and not need to be afraid of accidentally
locking the tag, or changing the configuration bytes, or someone maliciously locking your tag or changing your password. We suggest using NXP’s
TagWriter app.

NXP Semiconductors NTAG213/215/216
NFC Forum T2T compliant IC with 144/504/888 bytes user memory
8.5.1 UID/serial number
The unique 7-byte serial number (UID) and its two check bytes are programmed into the
first 9 bytes of memory covering page addresses 00h, 01h and the first byte of page 02h.
The second byte of page address 02h is reserved for internal data. These bytes are
programmed and write protected in the production test.
In accordance with ISO/IEC 14443-3 check byte 0 (BCC0) is defined as CT  SN0  SN1
 SN2 and check byte 1 (BCC1) is defined as SN3  SN4  SN5  SN6.
SN0 holds the Manufacturer ID for NXP Semiconductors (04h) in accordance with
ISO/IEC 14443-3.
8.5.2 Static lock bytes (NTAG21x)
The bits of byte 2 and byte 3 of page 02h represent the field programmable read-only
locking mechanism. Each page from 03h (CC) to 0Fh can be individually locked by setting
the corresponding locking bit Lx to logic 1 to prevent further write access. After locking,
the corresponding page becomes read-only memory.

NXP Semiconductors NTAG213/215/216
NFC Forum T2T compliant IC with 144/504/888 bytes user memory
The three least significant bits of lock byte 0 are the block-locking bits. Bit 2 deals with
pages 0Ah to 0Fh, bit 1 deals with pages 04h to 09h and bit 0 deals with page 03h (CC).
Once the block-locking bits are set, the locking configuration for the corresponding
memory area is frozen.
For example if BL15-10 is set to logic 1, then bits L15 to L10 (lock byte 1, bit[7:2]) can no
longer be changed. The so called static locking and block-locking bits are set by a WRITE
or COMPATIBILITY_WRITE command to page 02h. Bytes 2 and 3 of the WRITE or
COMPATIBILITY_WRITE command, and the contents of the lock bytes are bit-wise
OR’ed and the result then becomes the new content of the lock bytes. This process is
irreversible. If a bit is set to logic 1, it cannot be changed back to logic 0.
The contents of bytes 0 and 1 of page 02h are unaffected by the corresponding data bytes
of the WRITE or COMPATIBILITY_WRITE command.
The default value of the static lock bytes is 00 00h.
Any write operation to the static lock bytes is tearing-proof.
8.5.3 Dynamic Lock Bytes
To lock the pages of NTAG21x starting at page address 10h and onwards, the so called
dynamic lock bytes are used. The dynamic lock bytes are located at page 28h for
NTAG213, at page 82h for NTAG215 and at page E2h for NTAG216. The three lock bytes
cover the memory area of 96 data bytes for NTAG213, 456 data bytes for NTAG215 and
840 data bytes for NTAG216. The granularity is 2 pages for NTAG213 (Figure 9) and 16
pages for NTAG215 (Figure 10) and NTAG216 (Figure 11).
Remark: Set all bits marked with RFUI to 0, when writing to the dynamic lock bytes.
Remark: For the correct usage of the dynamic lock bytes with NFC devices for the
NTAG215 and NTAG216 refer to Ref. 8 “AN11456 NTAG21x Using the dynamic lock bits
to lock the tag”.

Copying access cards / fobs / badges to a chip implant
HDT Info M Primers

amal

This post will cover the steps to hopefully copy a card, fob, or badge you currently possess
(source chip) into a chip implant that supports cloning (target chip). | say “hopefully” because you
need a couple things to be right to make this happen.

Requirements
There are two things that are necessary for your source chip to be cloneable to a target chip.

e Your source chip needs to be a simple device with weak breakable security, or no security
features at all. Don’t worry, most access control systems use completely insecure chips that
can easily be read by anyone. This surprises some people, but it comes down to profit
margin for the security company and cost for the owners of the access system, so it should
not be that much of a surprise. Secure chips cost more, and therefore are not actually used
by many access systems.

Your source chip needs to have a compatible target chip. This simply means that we need a
target chip that is compatible with your source chip. Basically speaking, the programmable
target chip needs to be able to look like your source chip in every respect once the
programming (cloning) is done. Because chips with reprogrammable serial numbers (also
called UIDs) are not the norm, there are only a few types of source chips that can be cloned
to a target chip.

Basic steps to cloning

1. Identify if you have a card, fob, or badge (“source chip”) that can be cloned and determine if
a reprogrammable “target chip” exists which is compatible with your “source chip”

2. Purchase the tools and target chip implant, then perform the cloning procedure

Step 1) Identify the type of source chip you want to copy

There are two primary frequency families of passive RFID chips. There are LF (low frequency)
chips which operate on 125kHz, and HF (high frequency) chips which operate at 13.56MHz.
There is really only one type of HF chip that can be cloned, but many different types of simple LF
chips that can be. | cover the differences in this video!

So you want to clone your work badge, apartment fob, gym pass, etc. to a chip .

Dnz:rous

lay; \ xs

Can | clone my card / fob
to a chip implant?

————.

Steps to identify your chip

¢ Try scanning the source chip with an app called Taginfo using an Android phone preferably.
The app does exist for iPhone on App Store , but iPhone has some serious limitations
when it comes to scanning chips that are not specifically used for sharing NFC data, and
typically chips used for access control do not also have NFC data on them.

If your source chip fails to scan with your NFC enabled smartphone, you may need a
Proxmark3 in order to identify the source chip. On the plus side, you will probably need
a Proxmark3 to do the actual cloning as well, so it’s a descent investment.

13.56MHz Mifare Classic 1k chips

In the HF family of 13.56MHz chips, the Mifare “Classic” 1K chip is really only kind of chip that
has weak security and more importantly has a compatible target chip that exists which can look
and read like a Mifare Classic 1k chip, and that target chip is called a “Magic Mifare 1k” chip. The
Magic Mifare 1k chip comes in a few different flavors but the ones we sell are called genta and
genz. The differences between these two “generations” of the Magic Mifare 1k chips has to how
data is copied to the chip, which | detail in this post;

0 "magic" Mifare chips DT Info

The Mifare “classic” S50 1k chip? For many years the Mifare MF1!CS50 1k chip was used for
all kinds of applications as a “secure chip” for everything from access control to stored value
cards, and used for making localized payments within closed systems like public transit and
laundry services. However, it uses a security mechanism called “crypto1” which is a simple,
proprietary encryption mechanism that hardly has anything to do with modern cryptography. It
has been broken for many years now, b...

If you have a Mifare Classic 1K chip with a 4 byte ID, then the only products you can copy that to
are products that contain a Magic Mifare 1k chip; The xI1 , flexM1 , flexMT ,or the
Magic Ring.

125kHz common access chips

Most inexpensive access systems use one type of LF 125kHz chip or another because LF chips
tend to be simple, reliable, and very inexpensive. This also means almost all of them are not
secured in any way. Common names for these types of low frequency chips include EM41xx,
EM4200, HID 1326 ProxCard II, HID 1346 ProxCard III, Indala, Pyramid, Viking, AMV, ioProx,
Presco (and more).

The good news is that a company called Atmel makes a 125kHz chip called the T5577 which
is specifically designed to be able to emulate a huge variety of common 125kHz access chips
used by various access control systems. That means if you have an LF 125kHz source chip in a
card, fob, or badge, then it’s very likely you could clone that to any of our products that contain a
T5577 chip. Here’s a video about the T5577 that explains why it’s such a cool chip.

If you have a low frequency source chip that the Proxmark3 can identify, then you will want a
product that contains a T5577 chip such as the xEM » NExT , flexXEM , flexXMT :
or the Magic Ring.

If you have a source chip that the Proxmark3 can recognize with an LF scan, and supports a
clone option within the command menu system for that type of LF chip, then you should be able
to clone it to a product with a T5577 chip. Check out this video for examples of how this is
done.

Accessing your home / car with a chip implant
HDT Info M Primers

amal 6g Nov 2021

Accessing your home with a chip implant

One of the most frequently used doors you'll need to unlock is the door to your own home. This
post covers what it will take to set up your own home and / or car to be accessed using a chip
implant.

a

If you are lucky enough to be able to change the locks in your door, then the process of
upgrading should be fairly simple. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I’m not familiar with
any electronic door locks that can read RFID chips and also fit retro overtop of an existing door
lock, which would be necessary for people who rent or are otherwise unable or not allowed to
change the locks in their door.

There are many different types and styles of door locks around the world. The image above
shows a US deadbolt lock. Luckily we have a dedicated community here on this forum that come
from all over the world. They have been diligently reporting results with various door locks, and
so there is a constantly updated compatibility matrix we all regularly contribute to that can help
you find a door lock that fits your door and which products it works with.

& Chip compatibility matrix - Google Sheets WIKIs

As the title suggests, We have a Google Sheets Spreadsheet compiled by, and for the DT
(and Vivokey) Forum members. It is a comprehensive, yet not an exhaustive list of products
and the DT / Vivokey products they are compatible with.
[Screenshot_20200708-204900_Sheets] [image] It is a living document, as we continue to
add to and update as we go, Therefore, if you see an error, omission, please post a reply in
this thread below. The more information you provide the easier it will make it fo...

Accessing your car with a chip implant

Sorting out how to access and drive your car is, unfortunately, far less simple than home door
locks. Unless you drive a Tesla (covered below), some level of modification will always be
necessary for your car to achieve a full key replacement using a chip implant.

¢ Traditionally keyed vehicles

Your standard keyed vehicle will usually have some sort of active fob system, either physically
part of the key or as a separate device, which is used by pushbutton to lock and unlock your door
and disarm the alarm.

This keyfob will typically need to be hacked in some way to properly manipulate the door locks
and the alarm. In addition to the lock control fob, the physical key inserted into the ignition will
likely also have an RFID transponder inside of it which is read by the car’s ECU to disengage the
immobilizer. Without this transponder, if you had a key that could turn the ignition switch, the car
would still not start. Hacking this ignition key transponder in some way will also likely need to be
part of the solution.

Finally, the steering column typically requires a physical turn of a key to disengage the steering
wheel lock itself so you can drive. These locks can be mechanically disengaged, but it requires
complete disassembly of the steering column to get at this locking mechanism.

Getting these kinds of vehicles to work with chip implants is extremely involved and difficult.
Essentially you have to completely disable all anti-theft measures put in place by the vehicle
manufacturer and then hack the lock controls too. It’s seldom worth doing if you are not a car
mechanic yourself.

e “Keyless” vehicle systems

This term is misleading because you still need a keyfob, but the point is that these systems use
an active key fob device that constantly transmits.

When in range of the vehicle, the doors (and trunk or hatchback door) will engage small unlock
buttons you can press to unlock just be walking up with the fob in your pocket. Likewise you can
sit in the car with the fob in your pocket and simply press the start button.

On the plus side, you don’t have to hack your car at all to get this kind of system working with a
chip implant. You only have to get a spare keyfob and hack that! There are several ways to go
about this process, but the basic concept is that you will open the spare key fob and find where
the battery connects to the key. You will create a switch for this battery using an RFID reader so
that you scan your chip, the key fob gets power and the car “sees” the key fob is in range. Then
all the door buttons will work and you can drive the car. When you scan your chip again, the key
fob loses power and the car thinks the key fob has gone out of range.

Exactly how to do this has not been standardized or turned into a product yet, but there are
people on this forum that have experimented with just such a project. If you are interested in
exploring this option, post the make and model of your vehicle and indicate you'd like assistance
hacking your key fob. You are certain to get help from our amazing community here in no time.

e Tesla keycard access

If you drive a Tesla model 3, model Y, or the new 2021+ models of the S or X (and hopefully
Cybertruck, but we don’t know yet), then you should be able to access your car and drive away
using a keycard.

re

This is a special kind of passive RFID device called a Contactless Smart Card, or sometimes
called a Contactless Secure Element. What that means is that the chip inside this card doesn’t
just have a serial number and some memory for data storage, it is an actual small computer that
can run software called Java Card applications. Lucky for us, the Tesla keycard runs such a Java
Card application and it uses a special kind of encryption technology called public key encryption.

Also lucky for us, the application is extremely secure and cannot be hacked, however also does
not utilize (at the time of this writing) any authorization signature. The short story is, while the key
cards cannot be hacked to steal cars, you can register a non-Tesla RFID chip running the correct
software with your car and it will appear to be a key card to the Tesla vehicle.

There is currently only one kind of implantable RFID chip that can do this, and it’s called the
VivoKey Apex. There are a few different types of Apex products in development and those should
be released by the time you read this. Here are some relevant links.

e VivoKey Apex chips 501
e VivoKey Apex Ring 208
e Not A Keycard Application for Apex 97

Building your own access control solution

Part of the fun of hacking is making your own solutions. One of the ways we enable you to do
that easily is with our xAC v2 Access Controller. It is a special 125kHz reader with additional
memory and features on board that allow you to add chip IDs to a list of “authorized” chips, anda
relay on board that can trigger external events like open a garage door or special project box or
even a customized tool box 46 .

Your imagination is the limit!

Here are some videos that explain the xAC and an example of what's possible.

More Details

This kit definitely contains dangerous things. The flexEM transponder device has not been tested or certified by any regulatory agency for
implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The flexEM is one of our next generation, high performance, 125kHz RFID transponders with a 15577 chip inside. The T5577 is an emulator that can
behave like many different common low frequency chip types, including EM41xx, EM4200, HID 1326 ProxCard II, HID 1346 ProxCard III, Indala,
Pyramid, Viking, AMV, Presco (and more) access cards and keyfobs. It is compatible with many inexpensive but plentiful OEM and commercial low
frequency RFID readers and stand-alone access controllers like our xEM Access Controller.

The flexEM is coated in USP Class VI, ISO 10993 tested biopolymer which gives it an extremely thin profile and semi-flexible structure suitable for
installation just about anywhere. They are packaged in a gas plasma sterilized tyvek sterilization pouch that contains the flex implant which is then

packaged inside a sealed polymer bag.

The performance and range of the flexEM vs the xEM is significant.

* Copy other LF chip IDs to this chip

What this chip implant can't do

* Share data with NFC enabled smartphones

* Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
* Can't make payments with this chip implant

* Chip implants can't be used for GPS or tracking

Professional installation notes

Installation of a flexEM device should always be done by a professional.

¢ Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)
¢ Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only “semi-flexible”)

Scalpel Install Procedure

¢ Make a 20mm wide incision in skin

e Lift & separate dermal layer using elevator tool

e The subdermal “pocket” should be at least 25mm deep

« Remove all tools from installation site
Slide flex device under skin with sterile gloves — no forceps or tools
Side with chip visible should be facing up. Do not place silver backed side up.
Suture to close wound — do not pierce flex device while suturing

Important things to know about the flexEM

— The biopolymer is ISO 10993 and USP Class IV tested and certified, however the final product has not been tested post-processing, meaning
material changes during processing could render the final product unsafe in some way.

— There is no “preferred” location for installation of a flex device. Customers are free to install a flex into any area of the body their installation
professional is comfortable with, as long as it is in the fascia layer between dermis and muscle tissue and not in an area of flexion or under a gripping
surface. Even though we use images which suggest installation above the second metacarpal of one of the fingers, it is not an ideal location for such

a device. Fingers are filled with tendons, nerve bundles, and very important things all packed into a very tight space. We urge you to think about easier
locations like the back of the hand or in the arm/wrist.

There are a few different combinations of chip type, reader, and software that can all work to get
you logged in to your computer quickly. | will explain the different approaches in detail below.

1S014443A chip and the KBR1

The easiest method to log into a computer is to use the KBR1 reader with an 1SO14443A.
compliant chip implant. The KBR1 is what is known as a “keyboard wedge” reader. It works
by reading the serial number of any 1S014443A chip and then “typing” that serial number as if it
were a keyboard device being typed on by a human. The KBR1 requires no special drivers
or software to operate, simply plug it in and most modern computer systems will recognize it as
an additional keyboard. Scan a chip and the serial number will be typed out into whatever
application is active at the time, including computer login password dialog boxes. The KBR1

will not read any user memory, so if your chip is 1S014443A and also NFC compliant, and you
have some NFC data written to it, the KBR1 will not bother with that data. It will only read the
serial number and type that out.

a, eS

Win10 microchip implant login
with the KBR1 USB reader

Step 1) Simply plug in the KBR1 reader to a USB port on your computer.

Step 2) Bring up the Start menu and type sign to bring up Sign-in options under System
settings.

Step 3) Add an alternate sign in PIN code by tapping the Add button under the PIN section.
Step 4) Enter your current password to enable adding a new PIN.

Step 5) With the cursor in the New PIN box, then scan your chip to “type” the new PIN code
based on the chip’s serial number.

Step 6) Move the cursor to the Confirm PIN box and scan your chip again to again “type” the
serial number. The scan will be followed by a “carriage return”, also knows as what is typed when
you press the ENTER key. This means the PIN box will close as you have successfully added a
new PIN to your account.

Step 7) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen should ask for PIN code automatically,
not password. However if you are asked for a password, you will also be able to click a PIN code
icon to switch to PIN authentication. Scan your chip on the scanner and the serial number will be
typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow, automatically logging you in.

Logging in to Apple macOS

« macOs

Log into MacOS with a microchip implant and the KBR1

Step 1) Simply plug in the KBR1 reader to a USB port on your computer. On MacOS you
may be asked to confirm the type of keyboard connected, and the default selection should be
fine. It may also ask you to press some keys on the keyboard to verify your selection, but you can
just close this dialog window to move on.

Step 2) Bring up System Preferences and go to Users & Groups to access the Change
Password function.

Step 3) Bring up a text editor application you can use to capture the output of the KBR1
when you scan your 1S014443A compliant chip implant, then with the cursor in the text editor
window, scan your chip and the serial number of your chip implant will be “typed out” by the
KBR1 into the text editor window.

Step 4) Go back to the change password dialog window and enter your current password as
requested, then manually type the serial number output into the text editor into the New password
and Verify text boxes. You cannot copy and paste into these boxes, and your password is case
sensitive as well so the password you type must match exactly what was output into the text
editor.

Step 5) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen will ask for your password. Scan your
chip on the scanner and the serial number will be typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow,
automatically logging you in.

* Because MacOS does not offer an alternative PIN code style authentication option like we use
in the above Windows 10 example, you should be careful to remember your “new password” as
output by the KBR1 , just in case you find yourself without your KBR1 scanner and still
need to log in.

1S014443A chip, ACR122U , and Rohos software

The ACR122U is a PC/SC capable CCID reader that allows more low level commands to be
sent to the RFID chip it is scanning than the KBR1 does. The down side is that the reader
alone can’t do anything. It needs additional application software to do anything other than been
and show a green light on successful tag read. The upside though is that the ACR122U

reader can leverage commands and features interactions of the tags it interacts with.

Rohos Logon Key is software from rohos.com that allows some interesting authentication
options for Windows 10 and Mac OS, however the MacOS version does not support RFID like
the Windows version does.

Logging in to Windows 10 with Rohos

am Windows 10

Log into Win10 with microchip implant, ACR122U reader, and Rohos Logon Key

Step 1) Download and install Rohos Logon Key from https://rohos.com
Step 2) Run Rohos Logon Key and tap Setup Authentication Key

Step 3) Place your ISO14443A chip implant on the ACR122U reader so the light remains
green

Step 4) Enter your Windows 10 account password and hit enter

Step 5) Your key should now be enrolled. Now lock your screen or log out. Scan your chip on the
ACR122U reader and you should automatically be logged in.

The benefit of NFC is that it guarantees a reliable way for passive NFC chips to communicate
data in a standardized way with NFC capable devices like smartphones and other NFC readers.
All RFID chips have a serial number which typically cannot be changed (but some can!), and
some chips have additional programmable memory blocks. This additional programmable
memory is where NFC chips store the data to be shared with NFC readers.
NFC technology basics
All RFID chips which comply with NFC standards operate on HF or High Frequency (13.56MHz).
This is an important detail to remember because we also have LF or Low Frequency (125kHz)
chips which cannot be read or scanned by NFC devices or smartphones. Finally, because not all
RFID chips are NFC compliant, we also have HF (13.56MHz) RFID chips which do not comply
with NFC standards, but can in some cases still be read by certain NFC capable smartphones.
Reading NFC chips
The great news is, you don’t need any special app on your phone to read NFC data from an NFC
chip, that is handled by the phone’s operating system. If you scan an NFC chip that has a
website link on it, your phone will ask if you want to open the link. It’s as easy as that!
Programming NFC chips
To program an NFC chip with data you want to share, there are a number of different smartphone
apps that can be used. Some popular options are TagWriter 319 and NFC Tools 299 . Both of
these apps can easily program your NFC chips with sharable data like website links, contact
information, plain text data, or even custom binary data and automation task triggers for apps like
Tasker 79 .
#TODO# video showing how to program chips with tagwriter 96 or nfc tools 299 on android and

Popular NFC compliant chip implants
We have multiple chip implant products that are NFC compliant and can share data with
smartphones. | will list our most popular options below with short descriptions. If you have not
read the difference between x-series and flex products 136 , you might want to check that out
first, then come back to read about the products.

e xNT 149 - This is the original NFC implant, successfully crowdfunded in 2013. It is an entry
level, inexpensive NFC implant which has an unchangeable (read only) serial number and
can be programmed with a small amount of data (approx 873 bytes) good for sharing
website links, social media profiles, youtube videos, contact details, etc.

e flexNT 135 - This is the flex version of the xNT 149 . It has the same NFC chip inside as the
XxNT 149 but performs better with NFC readers due to its shape and size.

e NExT 235 - This is our next generation dual chip implant. It contains the same NFC chip as
the xNT 149 and flexNT 125 , however it also contains an additional T5577 46 chip inside
a single implant. The T5577 46 has no programmable user memory, only a serial number.
However, the advantage of the T5577 46 chip is that the serial number can be
programmed to emulate different types of common low frequency access cards, key fobs,
work badges, etc. using a special device called the Proxmark3 121 . To learn more about
that, check out this post about copying common cards and fobs 227 .

e xSIID 448. - If you like to show off a bit of flash, the xSIID 448 might be what you’re
interested in. This chip implant has a similar kind of NFC chip inside as the xNT 149 / NExT

235 . In addition, it has a connected LED that lights up when the chip is being read by a
reader. The LED comes in various colors too!
In fact, this forum has a whole collection of community members who like showing off their
blinkies.

A place to show off your xSIID 448 NFC + LED Implant Be aware that your xSIID 448 blinky
may not be visible for some time after installation due to blood surrounding the implant. It can
sometimes take days to a couple weeks for full brightness.

While the products listed above are our more popular NFC compliant chip implants, we have
many NFC compliant products including wearables and other accessories. Here are all of our
NFC compliant products.

If you are lucky enough to be able to change the locks in your door, then the process of
upgrading should be fairly simple. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I’m not familiar with
any electronic door locks that can read RFID chips and also fit retro overtop of an existing door
lock, which would be necessary for people who rent or are otherwise unable or not allowed to
change the locks in their door.

There are many different types and styles of door locks around the world. The image above
shows a US deadbolt lock. Luckily we have a dedicated community here on this forum that come
from all over the world. They have been diligently reporting results with various door locks, and
so there is a constantly updated compatibility matrix we all regularly contribute to that can help
you find a door lock that fits your door and which products it works with.

& Chip compatibility matrix - Google Sheets WIKIs

As the title suggests, We have a Google Sheets Spreadsheet compiled by, and for the DT
(and Vivokey) Forum members. It is a comprehensive, yet not an exhaustive list of products
and the DT / Vivokey products they are compatible with.
[Screenshot_20200708-204900_Sheets] [image] It is a living document, as we continue to
add to and update as we go, Therefore, if you see an error, omission, please post a reply in
this thread below. The more information you provide the easier it will make it fo...

Accessing your car with a chip implant

Sorting out how to access and drive your car is, unfortunately, far less simple than home door
locks. Unless you drive a Tesla (covered below), some level of modification will always be
necessary for your car to achieve a full key replacement using a chip implant.

¢ Traditionally keyed vehicles

Your standard keyed vehicle will usually have some sort of active fob system, either physically
part of the key or as a separate device, which is used by pushbutton to lock and unlock your door
and disarm the alarm.

This keyfob will typically need to be hacked in some way to properly manipulate the door locks
and the alarm. In addition to the lock control fob, the physical key inserted into the ignition will
likely also have an RFID transponder inside of it which is read by the car’s ECU to disengage the
immobilizer. Without this transponder, if you had a key that could turn the ignition switch, the car
would still not start. Hacking this ignition key transponder in some way will also likely need to be
part of the solution.

Finally, the steering column typically requires a physical turn of a key to disengage the steering
wheel lock itself so you can drive. These locks can be mechanically disengaged, but it requires
complete disassembly of the steering column to get at this locking mechanism.

Getting these kinds of vehicles to work with chip implants is extremely involved and difficult.
Essentially you have to completely disable all anti-theft measures put in place by the vehicle
manufacturer and then hack the lock controls too. It’s seldom worth doing if you are not a car
mechanic yourself.

e “Keyless” vehicle systems

This term is misleading because you still need a keyfob, but the point is that these systems use
an active key fob device that constantly transmits.

When in range of the vehicle, the doors (and trunk or hatchback door) will engage small unlock
buttons you can press to unlock just be walking up with the fob in your pocket. Likewise you can
sit in the car with the fob in your pocket and simply press the start button.

On the plus side, you don’t have to hack your car at all to get this kind of system working with a
chip implant. You only have to get a spare keyfob and hack that! There are several ways to go
about this process, but the basic concept is that you will open the spare key fob and find where
the battery connects to the key. You will create a switch for this battery using an RFID reader so
that you scan your chip, the key fob gets power and the car “sees” the key fob is in range. Then
all the door buttons will work and you can drive the car. When you scan your chip again, the key
fob loses power and the car thinks the key fob has gone out of range.

Exactly how to do this has not been standardized or turned into a product yet, but there are
people on this forum that have experimented with just such a project. If you are interested in
exploring this option, post the make and model of your vehicle and indicate you'd like assistance
hacking your key fob. You are certain to get help from our amazing community here in no time.

e Tesla keycard access

If you drive a Tesla model 3, model Y, or the new 2021+ models of the S or X (and hopefully
Cybertruck, but we don’t know yet), then you should be able to access your car and drive away
using a keycard.

re

This is a special kind of passive RFID device called a Contactless Smart Card, or sometimes
called a Contactless Secure Element. What that means is that the chip inside this card doesn’t
just have a serial number and some memory for data storage, it is an actual small computer that
can run software called Java Card applications. Lucky for us, the Tesla keycard runs such a Java
Card application and it uses a special kind of encryption technology called public key encryption.

Also lucky for us, the application is extremely secure and cannot be hacked, however also does
not utilize (at the time of this writing) any authorization signature. The short story is, while the key
cards cannot be hacked to steal cars, you can register a non-Tesla RFID chip running the correct
software with your car and it will appear to be a key card to the Tesla vehicle.

There is currently only one kind of implantable RFID chip that can do this, and it’s called the
VivoKey Apex. There are a few different types of Apex products in development and those should
be released by the time you read this. Here are some relevant links.

e VivoKey Apex chips 501
e VivoKey Apex Ring 208
e Not A Keycard Application for Apex 97

Building your own access control solution

Part of the fun of hacking is making your own solutions. One of the ways we enable you to do
that easily is with our xAC v2 Access Controller. It is a special 125kHz reader with additional
memory and features on board that allow you to add chip IDs to a list of “authorized” chips, anda
relay on board that can trigger external events like open a garage door or special project box or
even a customized tool box 46 .

Your imagination is the limit!

Here are some videos that explain the xAC and an example of what's possible.

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. The flexDF2 transponder device has not been tested or certified by any regulatory agency for
implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The flexDF2 is one of our next generation, high performance, RFID and NFC compliant transponders. The flexDF2 is coated in USP Class VI, ISO 10993
tested biopolymer which gives it an extremely thin profile and semi-flexible structure suitable for installation just about anywhere. The DESFire EV2
8kB NFC Type 4 multi-application chip inside the flexDF2 allows large, cryptographically secured data storage. They are shipped in small sealed plastic
tubes with chlorhexidine solution.

What can this chip implant do?

* Some types of access control applications
* Share data with NFC enabled smartphones
* Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
* Scan this chip implant to log into your computer

What this chip implant can't do

* Can't copy other chip IDs to this chip, ID is set
* Can't make payments with this chip implant
* Chip implants can't be used for GPS or tracking

Professional installation notes

Installation of a flexDF2 device should always be done by a professional.

¢ Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)
¢ Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only “semi-flexible”)

> Scalpel Procedure

> Needle Procedure

Important things to know about the flexDF2

— The biopolymer is ISO 10993 and USP Class IV tested and certified, however the final product has not been tested post-processing, meaning
material changes during processing could render the final product unsafe in some way.

— There is no “preferred” location for installation of a flex device. Customers are free to install a flex into any area of the body their installation
professional is comfortable with, as long as it is in the fascia layer between dermis and muscle tissue and not in an area of flexion or under a gripping
surface. Even though we use images which suggest installation above the second metacarpal of one of the fingers, it is not an ideal location for such
a device. Fingers are filled with tendons, nerve bundles, and very important things all packed into a very tight space. We urge you to think about easier
locations like the back of the hand or in the arm/wrist.

The TeslaFlex was an exercise in converting Tesla Model 3 key cards into flex implants. The origin of the TeslaFlex was a VivoKey Special Project in concert Amie DD.

This worked well, but it meant the only thing the TeslaFlex could do was open your Model 3. That’s not really great, so we worked to reverse-engineer the Tesla keycard Java applet that runs on the card and publish that as a VivoKey Apex compatible applet on Fidesmo called “Not A Keycard” 😉

Now we wait for the VivoKey Apex to be released!

Logging into your computer with a chip implant
HDT Info M Primers

amal

In certain scenarios, a chip implant can be used as a password replacement for computer login.
All of the possible options listed below require a product with an RFID chip that complies with the
1S014443A communication standard. What that standard is and how it works is not necessarily
important for you to know in depth, you just need to know products or product bundles contain
one. Here is a categorical list of products which do;

https://dangerousthings.com/category/iso14443A

That said, if you are looking for a good all around chip implant for general use cases like this and
other access applications, | would suggest looking at the NExT since this chip implant has
two actual completely separate chips (a 13.56MHz NFC chip and a 125kHz RFID chip) inside a
single implantable shell.

Now for a rundown of the computer login options.

© Windows 10
o Apple MacOS
¢ 1S014443A chip, ACR122U, and Rohos software
© Windows 10
o No RFID support for MacOS ®&

There are a few different combinations of chip type, reader, and software that can all work to get
you logged in to your computer quickly. | will explain the different approaches in detail below.

1S014443A chip and the KBR1

The easiest method to log into a computer is to use the KBR1 reader with an 1SO14443A.
compliant chip implant. The KBR1 is what is known as a “keyboard wedge” reader. It works
by reading the serial number of any 1S014443A chip and then “typing” that serial number as if it
were a keyboard device being typed on by a human. The KBR1 requires no special drivers
or software to operate, simply plug it in and most modern computer systems will recognize it as
an additional keyboard. Scan a chip and the serial number will be typed out into whatever
application is active at the time, including computer login password dialog boxes. The KBR1

will not read any user memory, so if your chip is 1S014443A and also NFC compliant, and you
have some NFC data written to it, the KBR1 will not bother with that data. It will only read the
serial number and type that out.

‘Danz:rous

a, eS

Win10 microchip implant login
with the KBR1 USB reader

Step 1) Simply plug in the KBR1 reader to a USB port on your computer.

Step 2) Bring up the Start menu and type sign to bring up Sign-in options under System
settings.

Step 3) Add an alternate sign in PIN code by tapping the Add button under the PIN section.
Step 4) Enter your current password to enable adding a new PIN.

Step 5) With the cursor in the New PIN box, then scan your chip to “type” the new PIN code
based on the chip’s serial number.

Step 6) Move the cursor to the Confirm PIN box and scan your chip again to again “type” the
serial number. The scan will be followed by a “carriage return”, also knows as what is typed when
you press the ENTER key. This means the PIN box will close as you have successfully added a
new PIN to your account.

Step 7) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen should ask for PIN code automatically,
not password. However if you are asked for a password, you will also be able to click a PIN code
icon to switch to PIN authentication. Scan your chip on the scanner and the serial number will be
typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow, automatically logging you in.

Logging in to Apple macOS

« macOs

Log into MacOS with a microchip implant and the KBR1

Step 1) Simply plug in the KBR1 reader to a USB port on your computer. On MacOS you
may be asked to confirm the type of keyboard connected, and the default selection should be
fine. It may also ask you to press some keys on the keyboard to verify your selection, but you can
just close this dialog window to move on.

Step 2) Bring up System Preferences and go to Users & Groups to access the Change
Password function.

Step 3) Bring up a text editor application you can use to capture the output of the KBR1
when you scan your 1S014443A compliant chip implant, then with the cursor in the text editor
window, scan your chip and the serial number of your chip implant will be “typed out” by the
KBR1 into the text editor window.

Step 4) Go back to the change password dialog window and enter your current password as
requested, then manually type the serial number output into the text editor into the New password
and Verify text boxes. You cannot copy and paste into these boxes, and your password is case
sensitive as well so the password you type must match exactly what was output into the text
editor.

Step 5) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen will ask for your password. Scan your
chip on the scanner and the serial number will be typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow,
automatically logging you in.

* Because MacOS does not offer an alternative PIN code style authentication option like we use
in the above Windows 10 example, you should be careful to remember your “new password” as
output by the KBR1 , just in case you find yourself without your KBR1 scanner and still
need to log in.

1S014443A chip, ACR122U , and Rohos software

The ACR122U is a PC/SC capable CCID reader that allows more low level commands to be
sent to the RFID chip it is scanning than the KBR1 does. The down side is that the reader
alone can’t do anything. It needs additional application software to do anything other than been
and show a green light on successful tag read. The upside though is that the ACR122U

reader can leverage commands and features interactions of the tags it interacts with.

Rohos Logon Key is software from rohos.com that allows some interesting authentication
options for Windows 10 and Mac OS, however the MacOS version does not support RFID like
the Windows version does.

Logging in to Windows 10 with Rohos

am Windows 10

Log into Win10 with microchip implant, ACR122U reader, and Rohos Logon Key

Step 1) Download and install Rohos Logon Key from https://rohos.com
Step 2) Run Rohos Logon Key and tap Setup Authentication Key

Step 3) Place your ISO14443A chip implant on the ACR122U reader so the light remains
green

Step 4) Enter your Windows 10 account password and hit enter

Step 5) Your key should now be enrolled. Now lock your screen or log out. Scan your chip on the
ACR122U reader and you should automatically be logged in.

Accessing your home / car with a chip implant

Accessing your home with a chip implant

One of the most frequently used doors you'll need to unlock is the door to your own home. This
post covers what it will take to set up your own home and / or car to be accessed using a chip
implant.

a

If you are lucky enough to be able to change the locks in your door, then the process of
upgrading should be fairly simple. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I’m not familiar with
any electronic door locks that can read RFID chips and also fit retro overtop of an existing door
lock, which would be necessary for people who rent or are otherwise unable or not allowed to
change the locks in their door.

There are many different types and styles of door locks around the world. The image above
shows a US deadbolt lock. Luckily we have a dedicated community here on this forum that come
from all over the world. They have been diligently reporting results with various door locks, and
so there is a constantly updated compatibility matrix we all regularly contribute to that can help
you find a door lock that fits your door and which products it works with.

& Chip compatibility matrix - Google Sheets WIKIs

As the title suggests, We have a Google Sheets Spreadsheet compiled by, and for the DT
(and Vivokey) Forum members. It is a comprehensive, yet not an exhaustive list of products
and the DT / Vivokey products they are compatible with.
[Screenshot_20200708-204900_Sheets] [image] It is a living document, as we continue to
add to and update as we go, Therefore, if you see an error, omission, please post a reply in
this thread below. The more information you provide the easier it will make it fo...

Accessing your car with a chip implant

Sorting out how to access and drive your car is, unfortunately, far less simple than home door
locks. Unless you drive a Tesla (covered below), some level of modification will always be
necessary for your car to achieve a full key replacement using a chip implant.

¢ Traditionally keyed vehicles

Your standard keyed vehicle will usually have some sort of active fob system, either physically
part of the key or as a separate device, which is used by pushbutton to lock and unlock your door
and disarm the alarm.

This keyfob will typically need to be hacked in some way to properly manipulate the door locks
and the alarm. In addition to the lock control fob, the physical key inserted into the ignition will
likely also have an RFID transponder inside of it which is read by the car’s ECU to disengage the
immobilizer. Without this transponder, if you had a key that could turn the ignition switch, the car
would still not start. Hacking this ignition key transponder in some way will also likely need to be
part of the solution.

Finally, the steering column typically requires a physical turn of a key to disengage the steering
wheel lock itself so you can drive. These locks can be mechanically disengaged, but it requires
complete disassembly of the steering column to get at this locking mechanism.

Getting these kinds of vehicles to work with chip implants is extremely involved and difficult.
Essentially you have to completely disable all anti-theft measures put in place by the vehicle
manufacturer and then hack the lock controls too. It’s seldom worth doing if you are not a car
mechanic yourself.

e “Keyless” vehicle systems

This term is misleading because you still need a keyfob, but the point is that these systems use
an active key fob device that constantly transmits.

When in range of the vehicle, the doors (and trunk or hatchback door) will engage small unlock
buttons you can press to unlock just be walking up with the fob in your pocket. Likewise you can
sit in the car with the fob in your pocket and simply press the start button.

On the plus side, you don’t have to hack your car at all to get this kind of system working with a
chip implant. You only have to get a spare keyfob and hack that! There are several ways to go
about this process, but the basic concept is that you will open the spare key fob and find where
the battery connects to the key. You will create a switch for this battery using an RFID reader so
that you scan your chip, the key fob gets power and the car “sees” the key fob is in range. Then
all the door buttons will work and you can drive the car. When you scan your chip again, the key
fob loses power and the car thinks the key fob has gone out of range.

Exactly how to do this has not been standardized or turned into a product yet, but there are
people on this forum that have experimented with just such a project. If you are interested in
exploring this option, post the make and model of your vehicle and indicate you'd like assistance
hacking your key fob. You are certain to get help from our amazing community here in no time.

e Tesla keycard access

If you drive a Tesla model 3, model Y, or the new 2021+ models of the S or X (and hopefully
Cybertruck, but we don’t know yet), then you should be able to access your car and drive away
using a keycard.

re

This is a special kind of passive RFID device called a Contactless Smart Card, or sometimes
called a Contactless Secure Element. What that means is that the chip inside this card doesn’t
just have a serial number and some memory for data storage, it is an actual small computer that
can run software called Java Card applications. Lucky for us, the Tesla keycard runs such a Java
Card application and it uses a special kind of encryption technology called public key encryption.

Also lucky for us, the application is extremely secure and cannot be hacked, however also does
not utilize (at the time of this writing) any authorization signature. The short story is, while the key
cards cannot be hacked to steal cars, you can register a non-Tesla RFID chip running the correct
software with your car and it will appear to be a key card to the Tesla vehicle.

There is currently only one kind of implantable RFID chip that can do this, and it’s called the
VivoKey Apex. There are a few different types of Apex products in development and those should
be released by the time you read this. Here are some relevant links.

e VivoKey Apex chips 501
e VivoKey Apex Ring 208
e Not A Keycard Application for Apex 97

Building your own access control solution

Part of the fun of hacking is making your own solutions. One of the ways we enable you to do
that easily is with our xAC v2 Access Controller. It is a special 125kHz reader with additional
memory and features on board that allow you to add chip IDs to a list of “authorized” chips, anda
relay on board that can trigger external events like open a garage door or special project box or
even a customized tool box 46 .

Your imagination is the limit!

Here are some videos that explain the xAC and an example of what's possible.

More Details

This kit definitely contains dangerous things. The flexM7 transponder has not been tested or certified by any regulatory agency for
implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

What's so great about the flexM1?

Basically, for many years the MF1ICS50 1k chip was used for all kinds of applications as a “secure chip” for everything from access control to stored
value cards, and used for making localized payments within closed systems like public transit and laundry services. However, its security mechanism
called “crypto1” is a simple, proprietary encryption mechanism that hardly has anything to do with modern cryptography. It has been broken for many
years now, but the sheer number of systems out there that still use it means the S50 1k chip will continue to be used by legacy systems around the
world for years to come. So now, you can crack the security on those cards and clone their content (including the 4 byte non-unique ID or NUID “serial
number”) to your flexM1!

What can this chip implant do?

* Copy certain HF chip IDs to this chip
* Some types of access control applications
* Scan this chip implant to log into your computer

What this chip implant can't do

* Share data with NFC enabled smartphones

* Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
* Can't make payments with this chip implant

* Chip implants can't be used for GPS or tracking

Basic features

¢ 13.56MHz ISO14443A Mifare “magic” S50 1k emulator chip

e Abyte ID and all of sector 0 is writable

¢ 10 year data retention. Rated for 100k writes per memory block.

e Embedded in 8mm x 38mm biopolymer encapsulation that is only 0.4mm thick

Common questions

© Q: What's the difference between the gen1a and gen2 version?
e A: Read the magic chip post on our forum!

¢ Q: How do | change the ID of my magic chip?

e A: Read the magic chip post on our forum!

¢ Q: How do I clone cards to my magic chip?

e A: Read the magic chip post on our forum!

/f you decide to purchase one of these units, be aware that “magic” chips come from Chinese grey market suppliers. Because the silicon IC
inside the flexM7 is not made by a large reputable RFID transponder company, proper functionality or performance is not guaranteed. That said, the
flexM1 still comes with our limited warranty protection.

Professional installation notes
Installation of a flexM1 device should always be done by a professional.

¢ Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)
¢ Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only “semi-flexible”)

> Scalpel Procedure

> Needle Procedure

Important things to know about the flexM1

— The biopolymer is ISO 10993 and USP Class IV tested and certified, however the final product has not been tested post-processing, meaning
material changes during processing could render the final product unsafe in some way. Testing is planned for later, however beta testers have had the
flexNT since April 2016 and report no issues. Dangerous Things founder and CEO Amal Graafstra underwent the first installation of a flexNT beta
device on 03/02/2016 above the second metacarpal of the middle finger of his left hand. So far the installation has healed excellently and there are no
signs of rejection or irritation at the installation site.

— There is no “preferred” location for installation of a flex device. Customers are free to install a flex into any area of the body their installation
professional is comfortable with, as long as it is in the fascia layer between dermis and muscle tissue and not in an area of flexion or under a gripping
surface. Even though we use images which suggest installation above the second metacarpal of one of the fingers, it is not an ideal location for such
a device. Fingers are filled with tendons, nerve bundles, and very important things all packed into a very tight space. We urge you to think about easier
locations like the back of the hand or in the arm/wrist.

— Flex devices are very durable. Here are some examples;

There are a few different combinations of chip type, reader, and software that can all work to get
you logged in to your computer quickly. | will explain the different approaches in detail below.

1S014443A chip and the KBR1

The easiest method to log into a computer is to use the KBR1 reader with an 1SO14443A.
compliant chip implant. The KBR1 is what is known as a “keyboard wedge” reader. It works
by reading the serial number of any 1S014443A chip and then “typing” that serial number as if it
were a keyboard device being typed on by a human. The KBR1 requires no special drivers
or software to operate, simply plug it in and most modern computer systems will recognize it as
an additional keyboard. Scan a chip and the serial number will be typed out into whatever
application is active at the time, including computer login password dialog boxes. The KBR1

will not read any user memory, so if your chip is 1S014443A and also NFC compliant, and you
have some NFC data written to it, the KBR1 will not bother with that data. It will only read the
serial number and type that out.

Win10 microchip implant login
with the KBR1 USB reader

Step 1) Simply plug in the KBR1 reader to a USB port on your computer.

Step 2) Bring up the Start menu and type sign to bring up Sign-in options under System
settings.

Step 3) Add an alternate sign in PIN code by tapping the Add button under the PIN section.
Step 4) Enter your current password to enable adding a new PIN.

Step 5) With the cursor in the New PIN box, then scan your chip to “type” the new PIN code
based on the chip’s serial number.

Step 6) Move the cursor to the Confirm PIN box and scan your chip again to again “type” the
serial number. The scan will be followed by a “carriage return”, also knows as what is typed when
you press the ENTER key. This means the PIN box will close as you have successfully added a
new PIN to your account.

Step 7) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen should ask for PIN code automatically,
not password. However if you are asked for a password, you will also be able to click a PIN code
icon to switch to PIN authentication. Scan your chip on the scanner and the serial number will be
typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow, automatically logging you in.

Logging in to Apple macOS

« macOs

Log into MacOS with a microchip implant and the KBR1

Step 1) Simply plug in the KBR1 reader to a USB port on your computer. On MacOS you
may be asked to confirm the type of keyboard connected, and the default selection should be
fine. It may also ask you to press some keys on the keyboard to verify your selection, but you can
just close this dialog window to move on.

Step 2) Bring up System Preferences and go to Users & Groups to access the Change
Password function.

Step 3) Bring up a text editor application you can use to capture the output of the KBR1
when you scan your 1S014443A compliant chip implant, then with the cursor in the text editor
window, scan your chip and the serial number of your chip implant will be “typed out” by the
KBR1 into the text editor window.

Step 4) Go back to the change password dialog window and enter your current password as
requested, then manually type the serial number output into the text editor into the New password
and Verify text boxes. You cannot copy and paste into these boxes, and your password is case
sensitive as well so the password you type must match exactly what was output into the text
editor.

Step 5) Now lock your screen or log out. The login screen will ask for your password. Scan your
chip on the scanner and the serial number will be typed as the PIN code and ENTER will follow,
automatically logging you in.

* Because MacOS does not offer an alternative PIN code style authentication option like we use
in the above Windows 10 example, you should be careful to remember your “new password” as
output by the KBR1 , just in case you find yourself without your KBR1 scanner and still
need to log in.

1S014443A chip, ACR122U , and Rohos software

The ACR122U is a PC/SC capable CCID reader that allows more low level commands to be
sent to the RFID chip it is scanning than the KBR1 does. The down side is that the reader
alone can’t do anything. It needs additional application software to do anything other than been
and show a green light on successful tag read. The upside though is that the ACR122U

reader can leverage commands and features interactions of the tags it interacts with.

Rohos Logon Key is software from rohos.com that allows some interesting authentication
options for Windows 10 and Mac OS, however the MacOS version does not support RFID like
the Windows version does.

Logging in to Windows 10 with Rohos

am Windows 10

Log into Win10 with microchip implant, ACR122U reader, and Rohos Logon Key

Step 1) Download and install Rohos Logon Key from https://rohos.com
Step 2) Run Rohos Logon Key and tap Setup Authentication Key

Step 3) Place your ISO14443A chip implant on the ACR122U reader so the light remains
green

Step 4) Enter your Windows 10 account password and hit enter

Step 5) Your key should now be enrolled. Now lock your screen or log out. Scan your chip on the
ACR122U reader and you should automatically be logged in.

Sharing information with NFC enabled smartphones

Sharing information with NFC enabled smartphones

NFC or Near Field Communication is a narrow standard applied to specific kinds of passive RFID
chips. In other words, all “NFC chips” are simply RFID chips, but not all RFID chips comply with
the NFC standard. So when | say “NFC chip”, | just mean it’s an RFID chip that complies to the
NFC standard.

The benefit of NFC is that it guarantees a reliable way for passive NFC chips to communicate
data in a standardized way with NFC capable devices like smartphones and other NFC readers.
All RFID chips have a serial number which typically cannot be changed (but some can!), and
some chips have additional programmable memory blocks. This additional programmable
memory is where NFC chips store the data to be shared with NFC readers.

NFC technology basics

All RFID chips which comply with NFC standards operate on HF or High Frequency (13.56MHz).
This is an important detail to remember because we also have LF or Low Frequency (125kHz)
chips which cannot be read or scanned by NFC devices or smartphones. Finally, because not all
RFID chips are NFC compliant, we also have HF (13.56MHz) RFID chips which do not comply
with NFC standards, but can in some cases still be read by certain NFC capable smartphones.

Reading NFC chips

The great news is, you don’t need any special app on your phone to read NFC data from an NFC
chip, that is handled by the phone’s operating system. If you scan an NFC chip that has a
website link on it, your phone will ask if you want to open the link. It’s as easy as that!

Programming NFC chips

To program an NFC chip with data you want to share, there are a number of different smartphone
apps that can be used. Some popular options are TagWriter 319 and NFC Tools 299 . Both of
these apps can easily program your NFC chips with sharable data like website links, contact
information, plain text data, or even custom binary data and automation task triggers for apps like
Tasker 79 .

Popular NFC compliant chip implants

We have multiple chip implant products that are NFC compliant and can share data with
smartphones. | will list our most popular options below with short descriptions. If you have not
read the difference between x-series and flex products 136 , you might want to check that out
first, then come back to read about the products.

e xNT 149 - This is the original NFC implant, successfully crowdfunded in 2013. It is an entry
level, inexpensive NFC implant which has an unchangeable (read only) serial number and
can be programmed with a small amount of data (approx 873 bytes) good for sharing
website links, social media profiles, youtube videos, contact details, etc.

flexNT 135 - This is the flex version of the xNT 149 . It has the same NFC chip inside as the
XxNT 149 but performs better with NFC readers due to its shape and size.

NExT 235 - This is our next generation dual chip implant. It contains the same NFC chip as
the xNT 149 and flexNT 125 , however it also contains an additional T5577 46 chip inside
a single implant. The T5577 46 has no programmable user memory, only a serial number.
However, the advantage of the T5577 46 chip is that the serial number can be
programmed to emulate different types of common low frequency access cards, key fobs,
work badges, etc. using a special device called the Proxmark3 121 . To learn more about
that, check out this post about copying common cards and fobs 227 .

xSIID 448 - If you like to show off a bit of flash, the xSIID 448 might be what you're
interested in. This chip implant has a similar kind of NFC chip inside as the xNT 149 / NExT

235 . In addition, it has a connected LED that lights up when the chip is being read by a
reader. The LED comes in various colors too!

In fact, this forum has a whole collection of community members who like showing off their
blinkies.

A place to show off your xSIID 448 NFC + LED Implant Be aware that your xSIID 448 blinky
may not be visible for some time after installation due to blood surrounding the implant. It can
sometimes take days to a couple weeks for full brightness.

All of our NFC compliant products

While the products listed above are our more popular NFC compliant chip implants, we have
many NFC compliant products including wearables and other accessories. Here are all of our
NFC compliant products.

If you are lucky enough to be able to change the locks in your door, then the process of
upgrading should be fairly simple. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, I’m not familiar with
any electronic door locks that can read RFID chips and also fit retro overtop of an existing door
lock, which would be necessary for people who rent or are otherwise unable or not allowed to
change the locks in their door.

There are many different types and styles of door locks around the world. The image above
shows a US deadbolt lock. Luckily we have a dedicated community here on this forum that come
from all over the world. They have been diligently reporting results with various door locks, and
so there is a constantly updated compatibility matrix we all regularly contribute to that can help
you find a door lock that fits your door and which products it works with.

& Chip compatibility matrix - Google Sheets WIKIs

As the title suggests, We have a Google Sheets Spreadsheet compiled by, and for the DT
(and Vivokey) Forum members. It is a comprehensive, yet not an exhaustive list of products
and the DT / Vivokey products they are compatible with.
[Screenshot_20200708-204900_Sheets] [image] It is a living document, as we continue to
add to and update as we go, Therefore, if you see an error, omission, please post a reply in
this thread below. The more information you provide the easier it will make it fo...

Accessing your car with a chip implant

Sorting out how to access and drive your car is, unfortunately, far less simple than home door
locks. Unless you drive a Tesla (covered below), some level of modification will always be
necessary for your car to achieve a full key replacement using a chip implant.

¢ Traditionally keyed vehicles

Your standard keyed vehicle will usually have some sort of active fob system, either physically
part of the key or as a separate device, which is used by pushbutton to lock and unlock your door
and disarm the alarm.

This keyfob will typically need to be hacked in some way to properly manipulate the door locks
and the alarm. In addition to the lock control fob, the physical key inserted into the ignition will
likely also have an RFID transponder inside of it which is read by the car’s ECU to disengage the
immobilizer. Without this transponder, if you had a key that could turn the ignition switch, the car
would still not start. Hacking this ignition key transponder in some way will also likely need to be
part of the solution.

Finally, the steering column typically requires a physical turn of a key to disengage the steering
wheel lock itself so you can drive. These locks can be mechanically disengaged, but it requires
complete disassembly of the steering column to get at this locking mechanism.

Getting these kinds of vehicles to work with chip implants is extremely involved and difficult.
Essentially you have to completely disable all anti-theft measures put in place by the vehicle
manufacturer and then hack the lock controls too. It’s seldom worth doing if you are not a car
mechanic yourself.

e “Keyless” vehicle systems

This term is misleading because you still need a keyfob, but the point is that these systems use
an active key fob device that constantly transmits.

When in range of the vehicle, the doors (and trunk or hatchback door) will engage small unlock
buttons you can press to unlock just be walking up with the fob in your pocket. Likewise you can
sit in the car with the fob in your pocket and simply press the start button.

On the plus side, you don’t have to hack your car at all to get this kind of system working with a
chip implant. You only have to get a spare keyfob and hack that! There are several ways to go
about this process, but the basic concept is that you will open the spare key fob and find where
the battery connects to the key. You will create a switch for this battery using an RFID reader so
that you scan your chip, the key fob gets power and the car “sees” the key fob is in range. Then
all the door buttons will work and you can drive the car. When you scan your chip again, the key
fob loses power and the car thinks the key fob has gone out of range.

Exactly how to do this has not been standardized or turned into a product yet, but there are
people on this forum that have experimented with just such a project. If you are interested in
exploring this option, post the make and model of your vehicle and indicate you'd like assistance
hacking your key fob. You are certain to get help from our amazing community here in no time.

e Tesla keycard access

If you drive a Tesla model 3, model Y, or the new 2021+ models of the S or X (and hopefully
Cybertruck, but we don’t know yet), then you should be able to access your car and drive away
using a keycard.

re

This is a special kind of passive RFID device called a Contactless Smart Card, or sometimes
called a Contactless Secure Element. What that means is that the chip inside this card doesn’t
just have a serial number and some memory for data storage, it is an actual small computer that
can run software called Java Card applications. Lucky for us, the Tesla keycard runs such a Java
Card application and it uses a special kind of encryption technology called public key encryption.

Also lucky for us, the application is extremely secure and cannot be hacked, however also does
not utilize (at the time of this writing) any authorization signature. The short story is, while the key
cards cannot be hacked to steal cars, you can register a non-Tesla RFID chip running the correct
software with your car and it will appear to be a key card to the Tesla vehicle.

There is currently only one kind of implantable RFID chip that can do this, and it’s called the
VivoKey Apex. There are a few different types of Apex products in development and those should
be released by the time you read this. Here are some relevant links.

e VivoKey Apex chips 501
e VivoKey Apex Ring 208
e Not A Keycard Application for Apex 97

Building your own access control solution

Part of the fun of hacking is making your own solutions. One of the ways we enable you to do
that easily is with our xAC v2 Access Controller. It is a special 125kHz reader with additional
memory and features on board that allow you to add chip IDs to a list of “authorized” chips, anda
relay on board that can trigger external events like open a garage door or special project box or
even a customized tool box 46 .

Your imagination is the limit!

Here are some videos that explain the xAC and an example of what's possible.

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While the biopolymer used to encapsulate our flex products is USP Class VI and ISO 10993
certified, our flex products have not been tested or certified by any regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device
is strictly at your own risk.

The flexNT is one of our next generation, high performance, RFID and NFC compliant transponders. It is coated in USP Class VI, ISO 10993 tested
biopolymer which gives it an extremely thin profile and flexible structure suitable for installation just about anywhere. The flexNT has the same
NTAG216 based NFC chip as our injectable xNT chip implant, however the flexNT offers many times the readability, range, and performance of the
XNT.

What can this chip implant do?

* Some types of access control applications
* Share data with NFC enabled smartphones
* Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
* Scan this chip implant to log into your computer

What this chip implant can't do

* Can't copy other chip IDs to this chip, ID is set
* Can't make payments with this chip implant
* Chip implants can't be used for GPS or tracking

Important Things To Know

It's going in your body, you should learn about things like performance expectations, installation procedure, first steps after installation, etc.

NTAG Chip Security

Why is this important?

The NFC chip inside this product is an NTAG family chip from NXP. This chip type was designed for use in more typical NFC applications such as
smart posters, labels, and other disposable use cases where the memory contents would typically be written and then locked so it could not be
changed. This is done using built-in “lock bytes” which are OTP (one time programmable). That means that once the lock bytes are turned on to
protect memory blocks, they can never be unlocked. Once any memory block is locked, it will forever be read-only, which is not ideal for a chip
implant. Also, many common NFC smartphone apps and software applications offer ways to “lock” or “protect” your tag, making it very easy to
accidentally lock your implant as read-only. Because of this, we have disabled the ability to change or set the lock bits in the NTAG chip
inside this product.

In addition to lock bytes, the NTAG offers a 32bit password protection function. It can be used to password-protect just writing to or both reading
from and writing to the user memory space of the NTAG chip. Regardless of what some NFC smartphone apps indicate, it is not possible to
remove or disable the password, it is only possible to set the password to the factory default hexadecimal value of OxFF OxFF OxFF OxFF. If the
password is not changed, and is set to the factory default, then anyone could easily authenticate, change your password, then write data or
change protection options for your chip implant to lock you out of your own chip. Because of this, we set a default password value of 0x44
Ox4E 0x47 0x52 which is ASCII code for DNGR (some older batches of NExT chips have the password 0x4E 0x45 0x78 0x54 which is the
ASCII code for NExT).

Finally, many of the critical configuration bytes used by NTAG chips are stored in the last few pages of the chip's memory. This means that it may
be possible for an NFC application that does not properly detect or honor the memory schema of the chip to accidentally attempt to write NDEF
record data (the data you're trying to store on the chip) overtop of the configuration bytes. For example, if the data you are attempting to write is
longer than the memory pages available, the remainder of the data might be written overtop of configuration bytes, which contain settings that are
potentially dangerous to modify. Accidentally writing to those memory pages could result in your chip’s configuration being irreversibly locked.
Because of this, we password-protect the configuration bytes from being able to be written to or updated by using the password feature
of the NTAG chip. Your chip implant leaves our factory with the entire user memory space still fully accessible and writable, while at the same
time the protect the configuration bytes and password values from being accidentally or maliciously overwritten.

Once your chip implant is installed, you'll be able to use any NFC smartphone app to write data to the tag and not need to be afraid of accidentally
locking the tag, or changing the configuration bytes, or someone maliciously locking your tag or changing your password. We suggest using NXP’s
TagWriter app.

flexDF NFC Chi

© 13.56MHz 1SO14443A & NFC Type 4 DESFire EV1 chip
e 7mm x 32mm x 0.5mm flexible biopolymer package

$149.99

More Details

This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While the biopolymer used to encapsulate our flex products is USP Class VI and ISO 10993
certified, our flex products have not been tested or certified by any regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device
is strictly at your own risk.

The flexDF is one of our next generation, high performance, RFID and NFC compliant transponders. The flexDF is coated in USP Class VI, ISO 10993
tested biopolymer which gives it an extremely thin profile and semi-flexible structure suitable for installation just about anywhere. The DESFire EV1
8kB NEC Type 4 multi-application chip inside the flexDF allows large, cryptographically secured data storage. They are packaged in a gas plasma
sterilized tyvek sterilization pouch that contains the flex implant which is then packaged inside a sealed polymer bag.

Professional installation notes

Installation of a flexDF device should always be done by a professional.

¢ Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)
¢ Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only “semi-flexible”)

> Scalpel Procedure

> Needle Procedure

Important things to know about the flexDF

— The biopolymer is ISO 10993 and USP Class IV tested and certified, however the final product has not been tested post-processing, meaning
material changes during processing could render the final product unsafe in some way. Testing is planned for later, however beta testers have had the
flexNT since April 2016 and report no issues. Dangerous Things founder and CEO Amal Graafstra underwent the first installation of a flexNT beta
device on 03/02/2016 above the second metacarpal of the middle finger of his left hand. So far the installation has healed excellently and there are no
signs of rejection or irritation at the installation site.

— There is no “preferred” location for installation of a flex device. Customers are free to install a flex into any area of the body their installation
professional is comfortable with, as long as it is in the fascia layer between dermis and muscle tissue and not in an area of flexion or under a gripping
surface. Even though we use images which suggest installation above the second metacarpal of one of the fingers, it is not an ideal location for such
a device. Fingers are filled with tendons, nerve bundles, and very important things all packed into a very tight space. We urge you to think about easier
locations like the back of the hand or in the arm/wrist.

The DESFire EV1 chip

MIFARE DESFire EV1 (MF3ICD(H) 21/41/81), a Common Criteria (EAL4+) certified product, is ideal for service providers wanting to use secure multi-
application smart cards in public transport schemes, access management or closed-loop e-payment applications. It is fully complies with the
requirements for fast and highly secure data transmission, flexible memory organization and interoperability with existing infrastructure. MIFARE
DESFire EV1 is based on open global standards for both air interface and cryptographic methods. It is compliant to all 4 levels of ISO/IEC 14443A and
uses optional ISO/IEC 7816-4 commands. Featuring an on-chip backup management system and the mutual three-pass authentication, a MIFARE
DESFire EV1 card can hold up to 28 different applications and 32 files per application. The size of each file is defined at the moment of its creation,
making MIFARE DESFire EV1 a truly flexible and convenient product. Additionally, an automatic anti-tear mechanism is available for all file types, which
guarantees transaction-oriented data integrity. With MIFARE DESFire EV1, data transfer rates up to 848 kbit/s can be achieved, allowing fast data
transmission.

The main characteristics of this device are denoted by its name “DESFire”: DES indicates the high level of security using a 3DES hardware
cryptographic engine for enciphering transmission data and Fire indicates its outstanding position as a fast, innovative, reliable and secure IC in the
contactless proximity transaction market. Hence, MIFARE DESFire EV1 brings many benefits to end users. Users can experience convenient
contactless ticketing while also having the possibility to use the same device for related applications such as payment at vending machines, access
control or event ticketing. In other words, the MIFARE DESFire EV1 silicon solution offers enhanced consumer-friendly system design, in combination
with security and reliability.

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While our chip implants have undergone several quality checks during manufacture and have been put through a battery of tests, nothing has been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Your personal decision to purchase and ultimately the safe use of these devices is strictly your responsibility and at your own risk. The module houses both an NTAG I2C NFC chip and an LED indicator tied to the energy harvesting pins of the NTAG I2C. This design ensures the LED does not interfere with operation of the NFC chip and always receives filtered power output regardless of field variance. The NExT v2 comes in a variety of colors and offers the 1kB (888 bytes) user writable memory. You can store website URLs, contact details, or arbitrary binary data and share that with anyone who scans your NExT v2 with an NFC enabled smartphone!

Testing process, return policy, lifetime warranty

Testing Process
Our x-series chips come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles and cannot typically be read while inside the needle. Because of this, we perform a full test on every x-series tag before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests on our x-series chips and cataloged those tests here.

Return Policy
We offer a 30-day money back guarantee! Read all about it on our return policy page.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free of charge. Read all about it on our warranty policy page.

Practical read range/performance expectation

Passive RFID and NFC chips are magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the tag and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including mobile phones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat labels and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series chips. Most mobile phones and reader devices have a “sweet spot” or two that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. Other devices, such as the Samsung Ezon electronic deadbolt lock, sometimes use wire wound coil antenna loops inside, which work much more reliably with small glass transponders like our x-series chips. You should not expect your USB reader or mobile device to achieve the same read range with our x-series chips that you normally get with a label tag or card style tag. Here are some example videos detailing typical read performance and how to find that “sweet spot”.

The X Field Detector (XFD) can help! The XFD is a diagnostic device that mimics the x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader. That’s why we include it in our deluxe bundle!

How/where are x-series chips installed? Aftercare? What to expect?

Our x-series transponders are typically installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. The reason they are installed in the hand has to do with the extremely short read range of x-series chips and the typical use case being some form of access control where the tag must be presented to a fixed reader of some kind. The suggested placement within the hand was chosen due to the lack of major nerve bundles or blood vessels running through that area.

Achieving a safe installation definitely requires a steady hand and experience performing aseptic procedures. Dangerous Things prefers our customers locate one of our professional body piercing or body modification partners to complete the installation of this product. If no partners are available in your area, you should be able to follow this guide to finding a professional in your area who is willing to assist you. For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

Can I get an MRI? What about airport security? Playing sports? etc.

You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation of our x-series transponders.

6. Error Handling
Several error conditions can be detected to ensure that only valid bits are programmed into the EEPROM. There are two
error types, which lead to two different actions.
6.1 Errors During Command Sequence
The following detectable errors could occur while sending a command sequence to the Atmel ® ATA5577C:
● Wrong number of field clocks between two gaps (that is, not a valid 1 or 0 pulse stream)
● Password mode is activated and the password does not match the contents of block 7
● The number of bits received in the command sequence is incorrect
Valid bit counts accepted by the Atmel ATA5577C are listed in the following table.
If any of these erroneous conditions (except AOR mode) are detected, the Atmel ATA5577C enters regular-read mode,
starting with block 1 of the page defined in the command sequence. An erroneous AOR wake-up command will stop
modulation (modulation defeat).

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While the xDF chip has undergone several quality checks during manufacture and has been put through a battery of tests, it has not been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The xDF NFC chip implant is an ISO14443A NFC Type 4 compliant transponder. It works with NFC enabled smartphones, certain commercial access control systems, various ISO14443A compatible door locks, as well as USB contactless ISO14443A readers. The DESFire EV1 is a powerful chip, capable of doing much more than simply holding NDEF record data for simple NFC applications. The true utility of this chip is best utilized by programmers and engineers, but there’s also nothing wrong with storing a lot of NDEF data on it either. The xDF has enough space you could store a vCard digital business card complete with all your contact information and even a small tiny photo of yourself on this chip.

The xDF also comes with some additional goodies, including a xFD field tester, and the RFID Diagnostic Card. The RFID Diagnostic Card is a nifty little tool you can use to easily detect what frequency and duty cycle any contactless reader is operating at. What it does not do is tell you where and how to place your xDF on the reader to get the best performance. That is where the xFD Field Tester comes in. Place the xFD up to a 13.56MHz reader and begin moving over the surface of the reader while trying different rotational orientations. Once the white LED inside lights up you will know that placing your xDF up to that reader in the same location and orientation will yield the best performance.

What can this chip implant do?

• Some types of access control applications
• Share data with NFC enabled smartphones
• Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
• Scan this chip implant to log into your computer

What this chip implant can’t do

• Can’t copy other chip IDs to this chip, ID is set
• Can’t make payments with this chip implant
• Chip implants can’t be used for GPS or tracking

Interesting DESFire Feature Comparison

Testing process, return policy, lifetime warranty

Testing Process
Our x-series chips come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles and cannot typically be read while inside the needle. Because of this, we perform a full test on every x-series tag before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests on our x-series chips and cataloged those tests here.

Return Policy
We offer a 30-day money back guarantee! Read all about it on our return policy page.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free of charge. Read all about it on our warranty policy page.

Practical read range/performance expectation

Passive RFID and NFC chips are magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the tag and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including mobile phones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat labels and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series chips. Most mobile phones and reader devices have a “sweet spot” or two that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. Other devices, such as the Samsung Ezon electronic deadbolt lock, sometimes use wire wound coil antenna loops inside, which work much more reliably with small glass transponders like our x-series chips. You should not expect your USB reader or mobile device to achieve the same read range with our x-series chips that you normally get with a label tag or card style tag. Here are some example videos detailing typical read performance and how to find that “sweet spot”.

The xFD can help! The xFD is a diagnostic device that mimics the x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader. That’s why we include it in our deluxe bundle!

How/where are x-series chips installed? Aftercare? What to expect?

Our x-series transponders are typically installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. The reason they are installed in the hand has to do with the extremely short read range of x-series chips and the typical use case being some form of access control where the tag must be presented to a fixed reader of some kind. The suggested placement within the hand was chosen due to the lack of major nerve bundles or blood vessels running through that area.

Achieving a safe installation definitely requires a steady hand and experience performing aseptic procedures. Dangerous Things prefers our customers locate one of our professional body piercing or body modification partners to complete the installation of this product. If no partners are available in your area, you should be able to follow this guide to finding a professional in your area who is willing to assist you. For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

Can I get an MRI? What about airport security? Playing sports? etc.

You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation of our x-series transponders.

xDF3 DESFire EV3 8kB NFC quantity

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While the xDF3 chip has undergone several quality checks during manufacture and has been put through a battery of tests, it has not been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The xDF3 NFC chip implant is an ISO14443A NFC Type 4 compliant transponder. It works with NFC enabled smartphones, certain commercial access control systems, various ISO14443A compatible door locks, as well as USB contactless ISO14443A readers. The DESFire EV3 is a very powerful chip, capable of doing much more than simply holding NDEF record data for simple NFC applications. The true utility of this chip is best utilized by programmers and engineers, but there’s also nothing wrong with storing a lot of NDEF data on it either. The xDF3 has enough space you could store a vCard digital business card complete with all your contact information and even a small photo of yourself on this chip with space to spare!

The xDF3 also comes with some additional goodies, including a xFD field tester, and the RFID Diagnostic Card. The RFID Diagnostic Card is a nifty little tool you can use to easily detect what frequency and duty cycle any contactless reader is operating at. What it does not do is tell you where and how to place your xDF3 on the reader to get the best performance. That is where the xFD Field Tester comes in. Place the xFD up to a 13.56MHz reader and begin moving over the surface of the reader while trying different rotational orientations. Once the white LED inside lights up you will know that placing your xDF3 up to that reader in the same location and orientation will yield the best performance.

What can this chip implant do?

• Some types of access control applications
• Share data with NFC enabled smartphones
• Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
• Scan this chip implant to log into your computer

What this chip implant can’t do

• Can’t copy other chip IDs to this chip, ID is set
• Can’t make payments with this chip implant
• Chip implants can’t be used for GPS or tracking

Interesting DESFire Feature Comparison

Testing process, return policy, lifetime warranty

Testing Process
Our x-series chips come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles and cannot typically be read while inside the needle. Because of this, we perform a full test on every x-series tag before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests on our x-series chips and cataloged those tests here.

Return Policy
We offer a 30-day money back guarantee! Read all about it on our return policy page.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free of charge. Read all about it on our warranty policy page.

Practical read range/performance expectation

Passive RFID and NFC chips are magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the tag and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including mobile phones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat labels and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series chips. Most mobile phones and reader devices have a “sweet spot” or two that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. Other devices, such as the Samsung Ezon electronic deadbolt lock, sometimes use wire wound coil antenna loops inside, which work much more reliably with small glass transponders like our x-series chips. You should not expect your USB reader or mobile device to achieve the same read range with our x-series chips that you normally get with a label tag or card style tag. Here are some example videos detailing typical read performance and how to find that “sweet spot”.

The xFD can help! The xFD is a diagnostic device that mimics the x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader. That’s why we include it in our deluxe bundle!

How/where are x-series chips installed? Aftercare? What to expect?

Our x-series transponders are typically installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. The reason they are installed in the hand has to do with the extremely short read range of x-series chips and the typical use case being some form of access control where the tag must be presented to a fixed reader of some kind. The suggested placement within the hand was chosen due to the lack of major nerve bundles or blood vessels running through that area.

Achieving a safe installation definitely requires a steady hand and experience performing aseptic procedures. Dangerous Things prefers our customers locate one of our professional body piercing or body modification partners to complete the installation of this product. If no partners are available in your area, you should be able to follow this guide to finding a professional in your area who is willing to assist you. For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

Can I get an MRI? What about airport security? Playing sports? etc.

You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation of our x-series transponders.

xMagic Chip Implant quantity

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While our x-series chip implants have undergone several quality checks during manufacture, and have been put through a battery of tests, they have not been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.



The xMagic kit contains the xMagic chip implant and all the sterile procedure materials required for a professional to perform installation. The xMagic has two chips inside, a 13.56MHz ISO14443-A compliant “Magic” Mifare S50 Classic 1k gen1a or gen2 emulator chip, and a 125kHz T5577 emulator chip. Both chips are encased in a biologically safe 3x15mm cylindrical bioglass tube. The bioglass cylinder is laser sealed and the finished xMagic is tested for function before loading into the injector assembly. Then the injector assembly with xMagic tag ina 13.56MHz ISO14443-A compliant “Magic” Mifare S50 Classic 1k gen1a emulator chipside is placed into a sterilization pouch and sterilized with ethylene oxide (EtO) gas.

What’s so great about the xMagic?

Generally speaking, RFID and NFC chips have read-only unique IDs. These are used as a sort of serial number, which cannot be changed. The xMagic has two different chips inside which are designed to emulate many different types of commonly used simple RFID chips found in access badges, key fobs, gym cards, etc. This means you can copy or clone both the ID (serial number) of many types of chips to the xMagic!

13.56MHz Magic Mifare 1k gen1a
One of the chips in the xMagic is the “Magic Mifare 1k” emulator chip. For many years the Mifare MF1ICS50 1k chip was used for all kinds of applications as a “secure chip” for everything from access control to stored value cards, and used for making localized payments within closed systems like public transit and laundry services. However, it uses a security mechanism called “crypto1,” which is a simple, proprietary encryption mechanism that has no relation to modern cryptography standards. Even though crypto1 has been broken for many years now, the Mifare Classic 1k is still commonly used in all sorts of access control systems. That means you can crack the security on those cards and clone their content (including the ID “serial number”) to your xMagic using devices like our Proxmark3!

125kHz T5577
In addition to the Magic Mifare 1k emulator chip inside the xMagic, we also have the 125kHz T5577 chip which is designed to be able to emulate a wide array of chip types in the 125kHz range. Typically key fobs and access cards used for things like gym memberships, gates, apartment complexes, etc. which use a 125kHz chip are very cheap and have no encryption or security at all, making it extremely easy to copy an ID from one of these devices into your T5577 emulator chip using our Proxmark3 device!

What can this chip implant do?

• Copy certain HF 13.56MHz chip IDs to this chip
• Copy certain LF 125kHz chip IDs to this chip
• Some types of access control applications
• Scan this chip implant to log into your computer

What this chip implant can’t do

• Share data with NFC enabled smartphones
• Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
• Can’t make payments with this chip implant
• Chip implants can’t be used for GPS or tracking

A review of the RFID Diagnostic Card & X Field Detector devices

Difference between gen1a and gen2

The basic differences between the gen1a and gen2 have to do with how each chip type enables sector 0 to be written to. Sector 0 is where the chip ID lives, as well as some other information like manufacturer details and the MAD or Mifare Application Directory data. Normally sector 0 on Mifare 1kB chips is read-only and cannot be changed. Cloning a “real” Mifare 1kB chip to a magic Mifare chip requires copying all of the sector 0 data from the source chip to the magic chip. A gen1a magic Mifare chip allows sector 0 to be written to only after sending a special command to it. A gen2 magic mifare chip uses the normal access bits and keys A and B to control access to sector 0, just like any other memory sector in the chip. This means normal write commands can work with sector 0 on a gen2 magic mifare chip. For an in-depth explanation, please check out this post on our community forum.

pros and cons

• gen1a pros; backdoor command disables all keys and access controls on all sectors. Every sector is writable regardless of key settings. Impossible to lock a sector out.

• gen1a cons; can’t send the backdoor command with android apps, must use special programmer like a proxmark3. some readers actively detect gen1a and reject reads.

• gen2 pros; can program in the field using android MCT app for easy changing or programming while on the go. much harder to detect by readers looking for magic chips.

• gen2 cons; it is possible to get locked out of sectors if improperly programmed.

How to clone cards, fobs, etc. to the xMagic

Proxmark3
By far the most powerful tool you can use to work with RFID chips is the Proxmark3. It’s an open source RFID diagnostics and security research tool, so it comes in many flavors, shapes, and sizes. It’s flexibility and ability to update the firmware to support the latest security tactics and tools means it’s a great investment for anyone wanting to experiment with RFID. Here are some example videos that show how to use the Proxmark3 to clone both Mifare 1k and T5577 cards and fobs.

Mifare S50 Classic 1kB cloning
The original 4 byte “Classic” 1k Mifare card has only 4 bytes for an ID, and uses the vulnerable version of Crypto1 protocol. NXP (the company who makes Mifare chips) released a number of different updated versions of Mifare chips, including the Mifare Plus 1k and a Mifare “Classic” 1k EV1 (evolution one) chip. The memory structures of these new chips are identical to the original vulnerable “Classic” 1k chips but they have been updated with improved cryptographic algorithms and have 7 byte IDs not 4 byte IDs. While new attacks on these new chip types do exist, success is limited and you will not be able to copy the complete 7 byte ID number to the xMagic since the mifare emulator chip inside only supports 4 byte IDs.

You can check the chip type in your 13.56MHz card and fobs using the Proxmark3 or in some cases by scanning them with an NFC capable Android phone using the TagInfo app.

125kHz chip cloning
There are many types of 125kHz chips in use today that can be emulated by the T5577 chip in the xMagic. They have no security features, just different communication protocols. The T5577 chip is highly configurable so it may emulate many types of these communication protocols, making it a highly versatile chip! You can use the Proxmark3 to clone the following types of 125kHz LF (low frequency) chips to the xMagic. Currently that list includes; AWID, COTAG, EM, FDX-B, Gallagher, Guarall Prox II, HID Prox, Idteck, ioProx, Jablotron, Keri, Motorola, Nedap, NexWatch, Noralsy, PAC/Stanley, Paradox, Presco, Farpointe/Pyramid, Securakey, and Viking.

xSIID Chip Implant
The xSIID is a next generation NFC compliant microchip implant which leverages the SIID, an innovative OEM module design from Dsruptive. The module houses both an NTAG I2C NFC chip and an LED indicator tied to the energy harvesting pins of the NTAG I2C. This design ensures the LED does not interfere with operation of the NFC chip and always receives filtered power output regardless of field variance. The xSIID comes in a variety of colors and offers the 1kB (888 bytes) user writable memory. You can store website URLs, contact details, or arbitrary binary data and share that with anyone who scans your xSIID with an NFC enabled smartphone!

xEM 125kHz T5577 Chip Implant
The xEM implant contains a 125kHz T5577 RFID chip emulator that can behave like many different common low frequency chip types, including EM41xx, EM4200, HID 1326 ProxCard II, HID 1346 ProxCard III, Indala, Pyramid, Viking, AMV, Presco (and more) access cards and keyfobs. The xEM is a great introductory chip for people just getting into RFID projects. It is compatible with many inexpensive OEM and commercial low frequency RFID readers and stand-alone access controllers like our xEM Access Controller. Check out our video explaining how the T5577 works.

Field Detection Tools

The following accessories also come with the standard kit. These accessories are “field detection” tools designed to assist you with identifying the type of readers you may encounter, but also the best location and orientation to present your chip implant to any reader to get reliable performance.

RFID Diagnostic Card
125kHz X Field Detector
13.56MHz X Field Detector

Our X Field Detectors (xFD) will show you the best position and orientation to present your chip implant to any readers of the same frequency, while our RFID Diagnostic Card will tell you all about the frequency and duty cycles of random readers you encounter in the wild.

Access Kit

The Access Kit add-on includes our two most popular access control devices. Watch the unboxing video to see what’s inside!

xEM Access Controller
The xEM Access Controller (xAC) is a stand-alone access control module that works with any chip implant with a 125kHz T5577 chip inside to allow (or deny) access to anything you wire it into!

Projects people have created with the xAC v2
Here are some projects on our community forum that utilize the xAC v2;

• Garage door opener project
• Unlock the car
• Gun safe upgrade
• Wall safe upgrade
• Another garage door opener
• Start the car
• Magic toolbox

KBR1 Keyboard Wedge Reader
The KBR1 keyboard wedge reader is a USB device that acts like a keyboard when plugged in! If you present any 13.56MHz ISO14443A NFC chip to the KBR1, it reads the UID (serial number) and “types out” that UID as if someone had typed it on a keyboard. This can easily be used as a simple but effective computer login solution for Windows or Mac!

ADD ON: Proxmark3 Easy

The Proxmark3 Easy is the world renown and de-facto standard premiere RFID research and programming tool. *slaps box* This baby will read, crack, clone, and program just about any RFID or NFC tag you come across. It slices, it dices, it mixes, it fixes! Seriously, if you want to do anything with programming or cloning chips, this is the tool to use.

Important Things To Know

Please expand the sections below to read up on things like performance expectations, return policy, installation procedure, etc.

 The NTAG I2C chip used in the SiiD module we used to construct the xSIID implant has 2kB of memory, split into two large memory sectors. The problem is that the NTAG I2C chip is not commonly used by consumers, and at the moment there are no apps available that properly identify and read the entire user memory beyond 1kB. Please read this forum post carefully as it explains the issue and possible remedies; https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/so-what-happened-with-the-2k-memory-on-the-xsiid

Testing process, return policy, lifetime warranty

Testing Process
Our x-series chips come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles and cannot typically be read while inside the needle. Because of this, we perform a full test on every x-series tag before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests on our x-series chips and cataloged those tests here.

Return Policy
We offer a 30-day money back guarantee! Read all about it on our return policy page.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free of charge. Read all about it on our warranty policy page.

Practical read range/performance expectation

Passive RFID and NFC chips are magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the tag and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including mobile phones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat labels and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series chips. Most mobile phones and reader devices have a “sweet spot” or two that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. Other devices, such as the Samsung Ezon electronic deadbolt lock, sometimes use wire wound coil antenna loops inside, which work much more reliably with small glass transponders like our x-series chips. You should not expect your USB reader or mobile device to achieve the same read range with our x-series chips that you normally get with a label tag or card style tag. Here are some example videos detailing typical read performance and how to find that “sweet spot”.

The X Field Detector (XFD) can help! The XFD is a diagnostic device that mimics the x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader. That’s why we include it in our deluxe bundle!

How/where are x-series chips installed? Aftercare? What to expect?

Our x-series transponders are typically installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. The reason they are installed in the hand has to do with the extremely short read range of x-series chips and the typical use case being some form of access control where the tag must be presented to a fixed reader of some kind. The suggested placement within the hand was chosen due to the lack of major nerve bundles or blood vessels running through that area.

Achieving a safe installation definitely requires a steady hand and experience performing aseptic procedures. Dangerous Things prefers our customers locate one of our professional body piercing or body modification partners to complete the installation of this product. If no partners are available in your area, you should be able to follow this guide to finding a professional in your area who is willing to assist you. For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

Can I get an MRI? What about airport security? Playing sports? etc.

You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation of our x-series transponders.

NTAG I2C plus: NFC Forum T2T with I2C interface, password
protection and energy harvesting
Rev. 3.5 — 7 May 2019 Product data sheet
359935 COMPANY PUBLIC
1 General description
Designed to be the perfect enabler for NFC in home-automation and consumer
applications, this feature-packed, second-generation connected NFC tag is the fastest,
least expensive way to add tap-and-go connectivity to just about any electronic device.
NXP NTAG I2C plus is a family of connected NFC tags that combine a passive NFC
interface with a contact I2C interface. As the second generation of NXP’s industry leading
connected-tag technology, these devices maintain full backward compatibility with first-
generation NTAG I2C products, while adding new, advanced features for password
protection, full memory-access configuration from both interfaces, and an originality
signature for protection against cloning.
The second-generation technology provides four times higher pass-through performance,
along with energy harvesting capabilities, yet NTAG I2C plus devices are optimized for
use in entry-level NFC applications and offer the lowest BoM of any NFC solution.
I2C and NFC communications are based on simple, standard command sets, and are
augmented by the demo board OM5569/NT322E, which includes online reference source
code. All that is required is a simple antenna design (see Ref. 5), with no or only limited
extra components, and there are plenty of reference designs online for inspiration. NTAG
I2C plus development board is certified as NFC Forum Type 2 Tag (Certification ID:
58514).

Addressing a memory page beyond the limits above results in a NAK response from
NTAG I2C plus.
Pages that are locked against writing cannot be reprogrammed using any write
command. The locking mechanisms include static and dynamic lock bits, as well as the
locking of the configuration pages.
10.11 FAST_WRITE
The FAST_WRITE allows to write data in ACTIVE state to the complete SRAM (64 bytes)
in pass-through mode, and requires the start block address (F0h), end address (FFh) and
writes 64 bytes of data into the NTAG I2C plus SRAM. The FAST_WRITE command is
shown in Figure 26 and Table 31.
WARNING: Data is written directly to SRAM. If received CRC at the end of transmission
is wrong and response was a NAK, received (corrupted) data is still in SRAM. Hence it is
recommended to implement a protocol on top to ensure data integrity (e.g. include own
CRC at the end of the payload) when using SRAM.

xM1 "magic" 1k quantity

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While our x-series chip implants have undergone several quality checks during manufacture, and have been put through a battery of tests, they have not been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.



The xM1 kit contains the xM1 chip and all the sterile procedure materials required for a professional to perform installation. The xM1 chip is made with a 13.56MHz ISO14443-A compliant “Classic 1k” emulator chip, which is encased in a biologically safe 3x13mm cylindrical bioglass tube. The bioglass cylinder is laser sealed and the finished xM1 chip is tested for function before loading into the injector assembly, and the whole injector assembly with xM1 chip inside is EO gas sterilized.

What’s so great about the xM1 ?

For many years the Mifare MF1ICS50 1k chip was used for all kinds of applications as a “secure chip” for everything from access control to stored value cards, and used for making localized payments within closed systems like public transit and laundry services. However, it uses a security mechanism called “crypto1” which is a simple, proprietary encryption mechanism that hardly has anything to do with modern cryptography. It has been broken for many years now, but the sheer number of systems out there that still use it means the Mifare S50 1k will continue to be used by legacy systems around the world for years to come. So now, you can crack the security on those cards and clone their content (including the ID “serial number”) to your xM1!

What can this chip implant do?

• Copy certain HF chip IDs to this chip
• Some types of access control applications
• Scan this chip implant to log into your computer

What this chip implant can’t do

• Share data with NFC enabled smartphones
• Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
• Can’t make payments with this chip implant
• Chip implants can’t be used for GPS or tracking

1 sterile gauze pad for post-installation wound care
1 sterile expandable-fabric adhesive bandage
1 pair of non-sterile, non-latex procedure gloves
Kit Extras

The following accessories also come with the xM1 kit. These accessories are “field detection” tools designed to assist you with identifying the type of readers you may encounter, but also the best location and orientation to present your xM1 chip implant to any reader to get reliable performance.

1 RFID Diagnostic Card
1 13.56MHz X Field Detector

Our X Field Detectors (XFD) will show you the best position and orientation to present your chip implant to any readers of the same frequency, while our RFID Diagnostic Card will tell you all about the frequency and duty cycles of random readers you encounter in the wild.

A review of the RFID Diagnostic Card & X Field Detector devices

Difference between gen1a and gen2

The basic differences between the gen1a and gen2 have to do with how each chip type enables sector 0 to be written to. Sector 0 is where the chip ID lives, as well as some other information like manufacturer details and the MAD or Mifare Application Directory data. Normally sector 0 on Mifare 1kB chips is read-only and cannot be changed. Cloning a “real” Mifare 1kB chip to a magic Mifare chip requires copying all of the sector 0 data from the source chip to the magic chip. A gen1a magic Mifare chip allows sector 0 to be written to only after sending a special command to it. A gen2 magic mifare chip uses the normal access bits and keys A and B to control access to sector 0, just like any other memory sector in the chip. This means normal write commands can work with sector 0 on a gen2 magic mifare chip. For an in-depth explanation, please check out this post on our community forum.

pros and cons

• gen1a pros; backdoor command disables all keys and access controls on all sectors. Every sector is writable regardless of key settings. Impossible to lock a sector out.

• gen1a cons; can’t send the backdoor command with android apps, must use special programmer like a proxmark3. some readers actively detect gen1a and reject reads.

• gen2 pros; can program in the field using android MCT app for easy changing or programming while on the go. much harder to detect by readers looking for magic chips.

• gen2 cons; it is possible to get locked out of sectors if improperly programmed.

How to clone cards to the xM1

The first thing you have to do is ensure your source card or fob is a 4 byte “Classic” 1k card, not a new 7 byte “Mifare 1k” card. With the discovery of Crypto1 vulnerabilities in the “Classic” Mifare S50 1k and S70 4k chips, NXP (the company who makes Mifare chips) released a number of different updated versions of Mifare chips. These include Mifare Plus 1k and a Mifare “Classic” 1k EV1 (evolution one) chip. The memory structures of these new chips are identical to the real “Classic” 1k chips but they have 7 byte UIDs not 4 byte IDs. While new attacks on these new chip types do exist, success is limited and you will not be able to copy the complete 7 byte ID number to the xM1 since it only supports 4 byte IDs. If you have a Mifare “Classic” S50 1k card or fob you want to clone to your xM1, there are a few tools you can use.

gen1 tools
We’ve curated a couple tools from the internet (so, right there, you might want to consider skipping this option). It requires Windows and an ACR122U reader. You can download this toolset from here. Below is a video of how to use these tools.

Proxmark3
By far the most powerful tool is the Proxmark3 – an RFID diagnostics and security research tool that is open source, so it comes in many flavors, shapes, an sizes. It’s flexibility and ability to update the firmware to support the latest security tactics and tools means it’s a great investment for anyone wanting to experiment with RFID. While we do not offer a guide for how to use the Proxmark3 to clone Mifare cards to your xM1, there are plenty of other guides already written that detail how it’s done.

How/where are x-series chips installed? Aftercare? What to expect?

Our x-series transponders are typically installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. The reason they are installed in the hand has to do with the extremely short read range of x-series chips and the typical use case being some form of access control where the tag must be presented to a fixed reader of some kind. The suggested placement within the hand was chosen due to the lack of major nerve bundles or blood vessels running through that area.

Achieving a safe installation definitely requires a steady hand and experience performing aseptic procedures. Dangerous Things prefers our customers locate one of our professional body piercing or body modification partners to complete the installation of this product. If no partners are available in your area, you should be able to follow this guide to finding a professional in your area who is willing to assist you. For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

Can I get an MRI? What about airport security? Playing sports? etc.

You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation small cylindrical transponders like the Spark.

Practical read range/performance expectation

Passive RFID and NFC tags are magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the tag and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including mobile phones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat label tags, credit card style tags, and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series tags. Most mobile phones and reader devices have a “sweet spot” or two that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. You should not expect your USB reader or mobile device to achieve the same read range with the Spark that you normally get with a label tag or card style tag. Here are some example videos detailing typical read performance and how to find that “sweet spot”.

The X Field Detector can help!
The XFD is a signal diagnostic device that mimics the x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader. That’s why we include one in every kit! This video explains how it works.

Tag testing process, return policy, lifetime warranty

Testing Process
All implantable transponders come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles and cannot be read while inside the needle. Because of this, we perform a full test on every transponder before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests, cataloging those tests here.

Return Policy
We offer a 30-day money back guarantee! Read all about it on our return policy page.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While the xHT chip has undergone several quality checks during manufacture and has been put through a battery of tests, it has not been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The xHT RFID chip implant is a 125kHz ISO14223 compliant transponder. It is also fully compliant to ISO 11784/85 Animal ID and ISO 18000-2 AIDC RFID management standards. It also supports a 48 bit secret key based challenge / response authentication mechanism.

The xHT also comes with some additional goodies, including an 125kHz X Field Detector, and the RFID Diagnostic Card. The RFID Diagnostic Card is a nifty little tool you can use to easily detect what frequency and duty cycle any contactless reader is operating at. What it does not do is tell you where and how to place your xHT on the reader to get the best performance. That is where the X Field Detector comes in. Place the XFD up to a 125kHz reader and begin moving over the surface of the reader while trying different rotational orientations. Once the LED inside lights up you will know that placing your xHT up to that reader in the same location and orientation will yield the best performance.

No “anti-migration” coating means easy removal/replacement

Testing process, return policy, lifetime warranty

Testing Process
Our x-series chips come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles and cannot typically be read while inside the needle. Because of this, we perform a full test on every x-series tag before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests on our x-series chips and cataloged those tests here.

Return Policy
All sales of this product are final, and no returns will be accepted. We keep tight control over chain of custody on our products through manufacture, sterilization, warehousing, and shipment. We would never re-sell something that has left our control chain and been returned, and you would definitely not want to buy one either. Before you purchase, do your research to be sure you know you know the product’s features, capabilities, reader compatibility, performance specifications, limitations, etc.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free of charge.

Practical read range/performance expectation

Passive RFID and NFC chips are magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the tag and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including mobile phones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat labels and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series chips. Most mobile phones and reader devices have a “sweet spot” or two that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. Other devices, such as the Samsung Ezon electronic deadbolt lock, sometimes use wire wound coil antenna loops inside, which work much more reliably with small glass transponders like our x-series chips. You should not expect your USB reader or mobile device to achieve the same read range with our x-series chips that you normally get with a label tag or card style tag. Here are some example videos detailing typical read performance and how to find that “sweet spot”.

The xLED can help! The xLED is a diagnostic device that mimics the x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader. That’s why we include it in our deluxe bundle!

How/where are x-series chips installed? Aftercare? What to expect?

Our x-series transponders are typically installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. The reason they are installed in the hand has to do with the extremely short read range of x-series chips and the typical use case being some form of access control where the tag must be presented to a fixed reader of some kind. The suggested placement within the hand was chosen due to the lack of major nerve bundles or blood vessels running through that area.

Achieving a safe installation definitely requires a steady hand and experience performing aseptic procedures. Dangerous Things prefers our customers locate one of our professional body piercing or body modification partners to complete the installation of this product. If no partners are available in your area, you should be able to follow this guide to finding a professional in your area who is willing to assist you. For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

Can I get an MRI? What about airport security? Playing sports? etc.

You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation of our x-series transponders.

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While the xDF2 chip has undergone several quality checks during manufacture and has been put through a battery of tests, it has not been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The xDF2 NFC chip implant is an ISO14443A NFC Type 4 compliant transponder. It works with NFC enabled smartphones, certain commercial access control systems, various ISO14443A compatible door locks, as well as USB contactless ISO14443A readers. The DESFire EV2 is a very powerful chip, capable of doing much more than simply holding NDEF record data for simple NFC applications. The true utility of this chip is best utilized by programmers and engineers, but there’s also nothing wrong with storing a lot of NDEF data on it either. The xDF2 has enough space you could store a vCard digital business card complete with all your contact information and even a small photo of yourself on this chip with space to spare!

The xDF2 also comes with some additional goodies, including a xFD field tester, and the RFID Diagnostic Card. The RFID Diagnostic Card is a nifty little tool you can use to easily detect what frequency and duty cycle any contactless reader is operating at. What it does not do is tell you where and how to place your xDF2 on the reader to get the best performance. That is where the xFD Field Tester comes in. Place the xFD up to a 13.56MHz reader and begin moving over the surface of the reader while trying different rotational orientations. Once the white LED inside lights up you will know that placing your xDF2 up to that reader in the same location and orientation will yield the best performance.

What can this chip implant do?

• Some types of access control applications
• Share data with NFC enabled smartphones
• Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
• Scan this chip implant to log into your computer

What this chip implant can’t do

• Can’t copy other chip IDs to this chip, ID is set
• Can’t make payments with this chip implant
• Chip implants can’t be used for GPS or tracking

new user requirements.
MIFARE DESFire EV2 is the third generation of the MIFARE DESFire products family
succeeding MIFARE DESFire EV1 Contactless IC. It is functionally backward compatible
with both MIFARE DESFire EV1 and MIFARE DESFire D40 (MF3ICD40).
Figure 1 shows the relationship between the three generations of MIFARE DESFire
products. The latest generation encompasses the features from the older generation(s).
Therefore, allowing existing users of the older products to adopt the latest product with
minimum or no changes to their infrastructures.
MIFARE DESFire EV2 can be used as a MIFARE DESFire EV1 in its default delivery
configuration. Every new features would required an activation and/or the use of new
commands.

MIFARE DESFire EV2 offers a transaction oriented backup mechanism to prevent
inconsistent updating of data storage across multiple files during a tearing situation.
When transaction tearing occurs, either all data fields are updated or none is altered.
Besides the application file structure support, MIFARE DESFire EV2 offers many optional
features such as following:
• Delegated Application Management (MIsmartApp) for giving rights to third party
application creation and management.
• Multiple key set within an application with key rolling mechanism and key migration
supported.
• Shared files between two applications, supporting a single transaction over two
applications at the same time.
• Multiple keys for each access rights of files.
• Transaction MAC on application level, MACing the transacted data with a secret key on
the card and served as a proof of transaction to the backend system.
• Virtual Card Architecture providing a privacy protecting mechanism during card
selection.
• Proximity Check to prevent against relay attacks.
• Originality Check for verification of genuine MIFARE DESFire EV2 product from NXP or
its licensees.
The following chapters will provide basic description of some functionality on MIFARE
DESFire EV2. For a morel details description of each functionality on MIFARE DESFire
EV2, please see [1].
8.2 Contactless energy and data transfer
In the MIFARE product-based system, the MIFARE DESFire EV2 is connected to a coil
consisting of a few turns embedded in a standard ISO/IEC smart card. A battery is not
needed. When the card is positioned in the proximity of the PCD antenna, the high speed
RF communication interface allows data to be transmitted up to 848 kbit/s.
8.3 Anti-collision
An intelligent anti-collision mechanism allows more than one MIFARE DESFire EV2 in
the field to be handled simultaneously. The anti-collision algorithm selects each MIFARE
DESFire EV2 individually and ensures that the execution of a transaction with a selected
MIFARE DESFire EV2 is performed correctly without data corruption resulting from other
MIFARE DESFire EV2s in the field.
8.4 UID/serial number
The unique 7 byte (UID) is programmed into a locked part of the NV memory which is
reserved for the manufacturer. Due to security and system requirements these bytes
are write-protected after being programmed by the IC manufacturer at production time.
According to ISO/IEC 14443-3 during the first anti-collision loop the cascade tag returns
a value of 88h and also the first 3 bytes of the UID, UID0 to UID2 and BCC. The second
anti-collision loop returns bytes UID3 to UID6 and BCC.
UID0 holds the manufacturer ID for NXP (04h) according to ISO/IEC 14443-3 and ISO/
IEC 7816-6 AMD 1.

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While our x-series chip implants have undergone several quality checks during manufacture, and have been put through a battery of tests, they have not been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.



Maximize hand real estate with the NExT dual frequency chip implant! If you want the benefit of having both a high frequency NFC chip implant and a low frequency RFID chip implant, then the NExT is what you need! The NFC side of the NExT is an NTAG216 chip that works with 13.56MHz NFC capable smartphones, certain ISO14443A commercial access control systems, certain door locks, and USB contactless ISO14443A readers. The low frequency RFID side of the NExT is a 125kHz T5577 emulator chip that can behave like many different common low frequency chip types, including EM41xx, EM4200, HID 1326 ProxCard II, HID 1346 ProxCard III, and Indala access cards and keyfobs. Check out our video explaining how the T5577 works.

NExT Standard Kit

The NExT Standard Kit contains the following products and materials, which are designed to enable you to bring the kit to a professional installation partner for installation.

1 sterile injector assembly, pre-loaded with NExT dual chip implant
2 single use ChloraPrep antiseptic wipes
1 sterile gauze pad for post-installation wound care
1 sterile expandable-fabric adhesive bandage
1 pair of non-sterile, non-latex procedure gloves

The following accessories also come with the standard kit. These accessories are “field detection” tools designed to assist you with identifying the type of readers you may encounter, but also the best location and orientation to present your NExT chip implant to any reader to get reliable performance.

RFID Diagnostic Card
125kHz X Field Detector
13.56MHz X Field Detector

Our X Field Detectors (xFD) will show you the best position and orientation to present your chip implant to any readers of the same frequency, while our RFID Diagnostic Card will tell you all about the frequency and duty cycles of random readers you encounter in the wild.

Important Things To Know

It’s going in your body, you should learn about things like performance expectations, installation procedure, first steps after installation, etc.

Practical read range / performance

Passive RFID and NFC chips are batteryless, magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field that the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the chip and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including NFC enabled smartphones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat labels and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series chip implants. Most mobile phones and reader devices do have “sweet spots” that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. You should not expect your USB reader or NFC enabled mobile device to achieve the same read range with our x-series chips that you normally get with an NFC label, sticker, or card.

Locating the “sweet spot”
Not only is the correct location of a sweet spot necessary to find, but also the correct orientation. The best performance is achieved when the x-series lays across the antenna pathway of the reader antenna coil so the length of the x-series chip implant is perpendicular to the reader antenna coil. To help find an effective location and orienation to get the best read performance for your x-series chip implant, we created the X Field Detector. This diagnostic device mimics the cylidrical x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader by lighting up when the field coupling is strong enough to power the LED inside. Watch this video to understand how to use it.



How/where are x-series chips installed? Aftercare? What to expect?

Our x-series transponders are typically installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. They should be at least 5mm away from any bone or other implants to avoid possible impacts. The reason chip implants are usually installed in the hand has to do with the extremely short read range of most small chip implants. In the case of access control where the chip must be presented dirctly to a fixed reader of some kind, the hand is easily able to be properly positoned in front of the reader. To find out more about common installation locations of the hand, visit https://dngr.us/locations

Achieving a safe installation definitely requires skill and experience performing aseptic procedures. Dangerous Things prefers our customers locate one of our professional body piercing or body modification partners to complete the installation of our products. If no partners are available in your area, you should be able to follow this guide to finding a professional in your area. For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

Testing process, return policy, and lifetime warranty

Testing Process
Our x-series chip implants come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles, and because of this they cannot typically be read while packed inside the needle. This is why we perform a full test on every x-series tag before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests on our x-series chips and cataloged those tests here.

Return Policy
We offer a 30-day money back guarantee! Read all about it on our return policy page.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our implant products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is determined to be malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free of charge. Read all about it on our warranty policy page.

NTAG Chip Security

Why is this important?
The NFC chip inside this product is an NTAG family chip from NXP. This chip type was designed for use in more typical NFC applications such as smart posters, labels, and other disposable use cases where the memory contents would typically be written and then locked so it could not be changed. This is done using built-in “lock bytes” which are OTP (one time programmable). That means that once the lock bytes are turned on to protect memory blocks, they can never be unlocked. Once any memory block is locked, it will forever be read-only, which is not ideal for a chip implant. Also, many common NFC smartphone apps and software applications offer ways to “lock” or “protect” your tag, making it very easy to accidentally lock your implant as read-only. Because of this, we have disabled the ability to change or set the lock bits in the NTAG chip inside this product.

In addition to lock bytes, the NTAG offers a 32bit password protection function. It can be used to password-protect just writing to or both reading from and writing to the user memory space of the NTAG chip. Regardless of what some NFC smartphone apps indicate, it is not possible to remove or disable the password, it is only possible to set the password to the factory default hexadecimal value of 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF. If the password is not changed, and is set to the factory default, then anyone could easily authenticate, change your password, then write data or change protection options for your chip implant to lock you out of your own chip. Because of this, we set a default password value of 0x44 0x4E 0x47 0x52 which is ASCII code for DNGR (some older batches of NExT chips have the password 0x4E 0x45 0x78 0x54 which is the ASCII code for NExT).

Finally, many of the critical configuration bytes used by NTAG chips are stored in the last few pages of the chip’s memory. This means that it may be possible for an NFC application that does not properly detect or honor the memory schema of the chip to accidentally attempt to write NDEF record data (the data you’re trying to store on the chip) overtop of the configuration bytes. For example, if the data you are attempting to write is longer than the memory pages available, the remainder of the data might be written overtop of configuration bytes, which contain settings that are potentially dangerous to modify. Accidentally writing to those memory pages could result in your chip’s configuration being irreversibly locked. Because of this, we password-protect the configuration bytes from being able to be written to or updated by using the password feature of the NTAG chip. Your chip implant leaves our factory with the entire user memory space still fully accessible and writable, while at the same time the protect the configuration bytes and password values from being accidentally or maliciously overwritten.

Once your chip implant is installed, you’ll be able to use any NFC smartphone app to write data to the tag and not need to be afraid of accidentally locking the tag, or changing the configuration bytes, or someone maliciously locking your tag or changing your password. We suggest using NXP’s TagWriter app.

Can I get an MRI? What about airport security? Playing sports? etc.

You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation of our x-series transponders.

Passive RFID and NFC chips are batteryless, magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field that the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the chip and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including NFC enabled smartphones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat labels and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series chip implants. Most mobile phones and reader devices do have “sweet spots” that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. You should not expect your USB reader or NFC enabled mobile device to achieve the same read range with our x-series chips that you normally get with an NFC label, sticker, or card.

Locating the “sweet spot”
Not only is the correct location of a sweet spot necessary to find, but also the correct orientation. The best performance is achieved when the x-series lays across the antenna pathway of the reader antenna coil so the length of the x-series chip implant is perpendicular to the reader antenna coil. To help find an effective location and orienation to get the best read performance for your x-series chip implant, we created the X Field Detector. This diagnostic device mimics the cylidrical x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader by lighting up when the field coupling is strong enough to power the LED inside. Watch this video to understand how to use it.

Our x-series transponders are typically installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. They should be at least 5mm away from any bone or other implants to avoid possible impacts. The reason chip implants are usually installed in the hand has to do with the extremely short read range of most small chip implants. In the case of access control where the chip must be presented dirctly to a fixed reader of some kind, the hand is easily able to be properly positoned in front of the reader. To find out more about common installation locations of the hand, visit https://dngr.us/locations

Achieving a safe installation definitely requires skill and experience performing aseptic procedures. Dangerous Things prefers our customers locate one of our professional body piercing or body modification partners to complete the installation of our products. If no partners are available in your area, you should be able to follow this guide to finding a professional in your area. For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

Testing Process
Our x-series chip implants come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles, and because of this they cannot typically be read while packed inside the needle. This is why we perform a full test on every x-series tag before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests on our x-series chips and cataloged those tests here.

Return Policy
We offer a 30-day money back guarantee! Read all about it on our return policy page.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our implant products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is determined to be malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free of charge. Read all about it on our warranty policy page.

Why is this important?
The NFC chip inside this product is an NTAG family chip from NXP. This chip type was designed for use in more typical NFC applications such as smart posters, labels, and other disposable use cases where the memory contents would typically be written and then locked so it could not be changed. This is done using built-in “lock bytes” which are OTP (one time programmable). That means that once the lock bytes are turned on to protect memory blocks, they can never be unlocked. Once any memory block is locked, it will forever be read-only, which is not ideal for a chip implant. Also, many common NFC smartphone apps and software applications offer ways to “lock” or “protect” your tag, making it very easy to accidentally lock your implant as read-only. Because of this, we have disabled the ability to change or set the lock bits in the NTAG chip inside this product.

In addition to lock bytes, the NTAG offers a 32bit password protection function. It can be used to password-protect just writing to or both reading from and writing to the user memory space of the NTAG chip. Regardless of what some NFC smartphone apps indicate, it is not possible to remove or disable the password, it is only possible to set the password to the factory default hexadecimal value of 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF. If the password is not changed, and is set to the factory default, then anyone could easily authenticate, change your password, then write data or change protection options for your chip implant to lock you out of your own chip. Because of this, we set a default password value of 0x44 0x4E 0x47 0x52 which is ASCII code for DNGR (some older batches of NExT chips have the password 0x4E 0x45 0x78 0x54 which is the ASCII code for NExT).

Finally, many of the critical configuration bytes used by NTAG chips are stored in the last few pages of the chip’s memory. This means that it may be possible for an NFC application that does not properly detect or honor the memory schema of the chip to accidentally attempt to write NDEF record data (the data you’re trying to store on the chip) overtop of the configuration bytes. For example, if the data you are attempting to write is longer than the memory pages available, the remainder of the data might be written overtop of configuration bytes, which contain settings that are potentially dangerous to modify. Accidentally writing to those memory pages could result in your chip’s configuration being irreversibly locked. Because of this, we password-protect the configuration bytes from being able to be written to or updated by using the password feature of the NTAG chip. Your chip implant leaves our factory with the entire user memory space still fully accessible and writable, while at the same time the protect the configuration bytes and password values from being accidentally or maliciously overwritten.

Once your chip implant is installed, you’ll be able to use any NFC smartphone app to write data to the tag and not need to be afraid of accidentally locking the tag, or changing the configuration bytes, or someone maliciously locking your tag or changing your password. We suggest using NXP’s TagWriter app.You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation of our x-series transponders.

10.7 PWD_AUTH
A protected memory area can be accessed only after a successful password verification
using the PWD_AUTH command. The AUTH0 configuration byte defines the protected
area. It specifies the first page that the password mechanism protects. The level of
protection can be configured using the PROT bit either for write protection or read/write
protection. The PWD_AUTH command takes the password as parameter and, if
successful, returns the password authentication acknowledge, PACK. By setting the
AUTHLIM configuration bits to a value larger than 000b, the number of unsuccessful
password verifications can be limited. Each unsuccessful authentication is then counted in
a counter featuring anti-tearing support. After reaching the limit of unsuccessful attempts,
the memory access specified in PROT, is no longer possible. The PWD_AUTH command
is shown in Figure 21 and Table 39.
Table 40 shows the required timing.

Remark: It is strongly recommended to change the password from its delivery state at tag
issuing and set the AUTH0 value to the PWD page.

xNT NFC Chip
More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While our x-series chip implants have undergone several quality checks during manufacture, and have been put through a battery of tests, they have not been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.



The xNT NFC chip implant was designed by Dangerous Things and production of it was originally crowdfunded via an Indiegogo campaign in 2013. It works with NFC enabled smartphones, certain commercial access control systems, and USB contactless ISO14443A readers.

What can this chip implant do?

• Some types of access control applications
• Share data with NFC enabled smartphones
• Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
• Scan this chip implant to log into your computer

What this chip implant can’t do

• Can’t copy other chip IDs to this chip, ID is set
• Can’t make payments with this chip implant
• Chip implants can’t be used for GPS or tracking

Important Things To Know

It’s going in your body, you should learn about things like performance expectations, installation procedure, first steps after installation, etc.

Practical read range / performance

Passive RFID and NFC chips are batteryless, magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field that the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the chip and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including NFC enabled smartphones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat labels and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series chip implants. Most mobile phones and reader devices do have “sweet spots” that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. You should not expect your USB reader or NFC enabled mobile device to achieve the same read range with our x-series chips that you normally get with an NFC label, sticker, or card.

Locating the “sweet spot”
Not only is the correct location of a sweet spot necessary to find, but also the correct orientation. The best performance is achieved when the x-series lays across the antenna pathway of the reader antenna coil so the length of the x-series chip implant is perpendicular to the reader antenna coil. To help find an effective location and orienation to get the best read performance for your x-series chip implant, we created the X Field Detector. This diagnostic device mimics the cylidrical x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader by lighting up when the field coupling is strong enough to power the LED inside. Watch this video to understand how to use it.



How/where are x-series chips installed? Aftercare? What to expect?

Our x-series transponders are typically installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. They should be at least 5mm away from any bone or other implants to avoid possible impacts. The reason chip implants are usually installed in the hand has to do with the extremely short read range of most small chip implants. In the case of access control where the chip must be presented dirctly to a fixed reader of some kind, the hand is easily able to be properly positoned in front of the reader. To find out more about common installation locations of the hand, visit https://dngr.us/locations

Achieving a safe installation definitely requires skill and experience performing aseptic procedures. Dangerous Things prefers our customers locate one of our professional body piercing or body modification partners to complete the installation of our products. If no partners are available in your area, you should be able to follow this guide to finding a professional in your area. For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

Testing process, return policy, and lifetime warranty

Testing Process
Our x-series chip implants come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles, and because of this they cannot typically be read while packed inside the needle. This is why we perform a full test on every x-series tag before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests on our x-series chips and cataloged those tests here.

Return Policy
We offer a 30-day money back guarantee! Read all about it on our return policy page.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our implant products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is determined to be malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free of charge. Read all about it on our warranty policy page.

Securing your implant - first steps after installation

Why is this important?
The NFC chip inside this product is an NTAG family chip from NXP. This chip type was designed for use in more typical NFC applications such as smart posters, labels, and other disposable use cases where the memory contents would typically be written and then locked so it could not be changed. This is done using built-in “lock bytes” which are OTP (one time programmable). That means that once the lock bytes are turned on to protect memory blocks, they can never be unlocked. Once any memory block is locked, it will forever be read-only, which is not ideal for a chip implant. Also, many common NFC smartphone apps and software applications offer ways to “lock” or “protect” your tag, making it very easy to accidentally lock your xNT as read-only.

In addition to lock bytes, the NTAG offers a 32bit password protection function. It can be used to password-protect just writing to or both reading from and writing to the user memory space of the NTAG chip. Regardless of what some NFC smartphone apps indicate, it is not possible to remove or disable the password, it is only possible to set the password to the factory default hexadecimal value of 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF. If the password is not changed from the factory default then anyone could easily authenticate, change your password, then write data or change protection options for your chip implant to lock you out of your own chip.

Finally, many of the critical configuration bytes used by NTAG chips are stored in the last few pages of the chip’s memory. This means that it may be possible for an NFC application that does not properly detect or honor the memory schema of the chip to accidentally attempt to write NDEF record data (the data you’re trying to store on the chip) overtop of the configuration bytes. For example, if the data you are attempting to write is longer than the memory pages available, the remainder of the data might be written overtop of configuration bytes, which contain settings that are potentially dangerous to modify. Accidentally writing to those memory pages could result in your chip’s configuration being irreversibly locked.

How do we solve these problems?
To help our customers protect their tag from accidental modification or malicious attack, we have developed Dangerous NFC for Android. Our DNFC app allows customers to secure their tag by doing the following things;



Disable lock bytes so they cannot be used to lock any memory blocks as read-only
Update the password block with a custom, non-default password value
Update the memory protection option to write-only protection
Update the memory protection range to protect the configuration bytes

This approach allows the entire user memory space to be written to/updated, while at the same time protecting the configuration bytes and password values at the bottom end of the xNT memory space. This means an application cannot accidentally write data unintentionally to any configuration bytes. It also means the password of the xNT cannot be updated without first authenticating. This means you will need the current password in order to update or change the password. Without updating the dynamic memory protection range, it would technically be possible to just write a new password without first knowing the old password.

Ultimately, once secured by Dangerous NFC, you are free to use any other NFC app to write data to the tag and not need to be afraid of accidentally locking the tag, or changing the configuration bytes, or someone maliciously locking your tag or changing your password. We suggest using NXP’s TagWriter app.

Can I get an MRI? What about airport security? Playing sports? etc.

You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation of our x-series transponders.

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While our x-series chip implants have undergone several quality checks during manufacture, and have been put through a battery of tests, they have not been certified by any government regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.



The xEM implant contains a 125kHz T5577 RFID chip emulator that can behave like many different common low frequency chip types, including EM41xx, EM4200, HID 1326 ProxCard II, HID 1346 ProxCard III, Indala, Pyramid, Viking, AMV, Presco (and more) access cards and keyfobs. The xEM is a great introductory chip for people just getting into RFID projects. It is compatible with many inexpensive OEM and commercial low frequency RFID readers and stand-alone access controllers like our xEM Access Controller. Check out our video explaining how the T5577 works.

What can this chip implant do?

• Copy other LF chip IDs to this chip
• Some types of access control applications

What this chip implant can’t do

• Share data with NFC enabled smartphones
• Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
• Scan this chip implant to log into your computer
• Can’t make payments with this chip implant
• Chip implants can’t be used for GPS or tracking

Important Things To Know

It’s going in your body, you should learn about things like performance expectations, installation procedure, first steps after installation, etc.

Practical read range / performance

Passive RFID and NFC chips are batteryless, magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field that the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the chip and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including NFC enabled smartphones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat labels and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series chip implants. Most mobile phones and reader devices do have “sweet spots” that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. You should not expect your USB reader or NFC enabled mobile device to achieve the same read range with our x-series chips that you normally get with an NFC label, sticker, or card.

Locating the “sweet spot”
Not only is the correct location of a sweet spot necessary to find, but also the correct orientation. The best performance is achieved when the x-series lays across the antenna pathway of the reader antenna coil so the length of the x-series chip implant is perpendicular to the reader antenna coil. To help find an effective location and orienation to get the best read performance for your x-series chip implant, we created the X Field Detector. This diagnostic device mimics the cylidrical x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader by lighting up when the field coupling is strong enough to power the LED inside. Watch this video to understand how to use it.



How/where are x-series chips installed? Aftercare? What to expect?

Our x-series transponders are typically installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. They should be at least 5mm away from any bone or other implants to avoid possible impacts. The reason chip implants are usually installed in the hand has to do with the extremely short read range of most small chip implants. In the case of access control where the chip must be presented dirctly to a fixed reader of some kind, the hand is easily able to be properly positoned in front of the reader. To find out more about common installation locations of the hand, visit https://dngr.us/locations

Achieving a safe installation definitely requires skill and experience performing aseptic procedures. Dangerous Things prefers our customers locate one of our professional body piercing or body modification partners to complete the installation of our products. If no partners are available in your area, you should be able to follow this guide to finding a professional in your area. For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

Testing process, return policy, and lifetime warranty

Testing Process
Our x-series chip implants come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles, and because of this they cannot typically be read while packed inside the needle. This is why we perform a full test on every x-series tag before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests on our x-series chips and cataloged those tests here.

Return Policy
We offer a 30-day money back guarantee! Read all about it on our return policy page.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our implant products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is determined to be malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free of charge. Read all about it on our warranty policy page.

Can I get an MRI? What about airport security? Playing sports? etc.

You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation of our x-series transponders.

In the fixed-bit-length protocol, the time between two gaps is nominally 24 field clocks for a 0 and 56 field clocks for a 1.
When there is no gap for more than 64 field clocks after a previous gap, the Atmel ® ATA5577C exits the downlink mode. This
protocol is compatible with the Atmel T5557/ATA5567 transponder.
Figure 5-12. Fixed-bit-length Protocol
5.12.4 Long-leading-reference Protocol
To achieve better downlink performance, an enhanced Atmel ATA5577C reader places a reference pulse in front of the
opcode. This reference pulse is used as a timing reference for all following data, thus providing an auto-adjustment for
varying environmental conditions. The long-leading-reference protocol allows full compatibility and coexistence of both
Atmel T5557/ATA5567 and Atmel ATA5577C devices with both Atmel T5557/ATA5567 compatible readers and advanced
Atmel ATA5577C readers. However, only the Atmel ATA5577C devices can profit from the self calibration and the resultant
increase in write distance (see Table 5-1 on page 8 for option register settings).
In this mode, the reference pulse in front of the command is monitored. Depending on the pulse length, the remainder of the
command is either evaluated using the fixed-bit-length protocol, or is used as a measurement reference to evaluate the
following command bits. Otherwise, the following bits are considered as an invalid command.
a) For a reference-based command, the reference pulse (dRef) will have a length of 16 to 32 + 136 = 152 to 168 field clocks
(zero bit + timing bias = reference pulse). Hence, the expected length will lie between 152 and 168 field clocks. The
equivalent expected zero-bit length is then extracted and used as a reference for all following bits. The long-leading-
reference pulse in this case is used as a timing reference only, and does not contribute to the command data itself (see
Figure 5-13, part a on 21).
b) Should the first bit lie within the fixed-bit-length frame (for example, in normal mode: 0: 16 to 32 clocks; 1: 48 to 64 clocks),
the device will then automatically switch to the fixed-bit-length protocol (see Section 5.12.3 “Fixed-bit-length Protocol” on
page 20) and this first pulse will be evaluated as the first command bit. This allows compatibility with long-leading-reference
programmed Atmel ATA5577C devices interacting with Atmel T5557/ATA5567 readers, which do not send any reference
pulses (see Figure 5-13, part b on 21).
c) If an Atmel T5557/ATA5567 device interacts with an enhanced Atmel ATA5577C reader, the reference pulse (152 to 168
field clocks) is ignored by the Atmel T5557/ATA5567 and the following data bits will evaluated correctly. Therefore, an Atmel
T5557/ATA5567 device is compatible with an enhanced Atmel ATA5577C reader (see Figure 5-13, part b on 21).
d) Should the first bit correspond to neither (a) nor (b) then it will be rejected as an invalid command.

xBT Temperature Sensing Chip quantity

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. While the xBT (LifeChip) transponder device has undergone several quality checks during manufacture and has been put through a battery of tests with various private labs, it has not been tested or certified by any regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The xBT kit contains the xBT chip and all the sterile procedure materials required to perform installation. The xBT chip is made with 134kHz FDX-B compliant Bio-Thermo LifeChip, which is encased in biologically safe 2.4×14.5mm cylindrical borosilicate bioglass tube and shipped in a sterilized injection assembly. The xBT reports a simple ID number which works with any FDX-B reader, and can also transmit temperature sensor data to a compatible Bio-Thermo reader.

The xBT chip is not an NFC device!
To read the xBT chip and get temperature data, we suggest using the Halo scanner from Micro-ID.

xBT Kit Contents
1 sterile injector assembly, pre-loaded with an xBT chip
2 single use ChloraPrep antiseptic wipes
1 sterile gauze pad for post-injection wound care

Testing process, return policy, lifetime warranty

Testing Process
Our x-series chips come pre-loaded inside injector systems with steel needles and cannot typically be read while inside the needle. Because of this, we perform a full test on every x-series tag before it is loaded into the injector assembly and sterilized. We have also conducted several tests on our x-series chips and cataloged those tests here.

Return Policy
We offer a 30-day money back guarantee! Read all about it on our return policy page.

Lifetime Warranty
If you do purchase one of our products and experience a failure, we offer a full lifetime warranty on all of our products. You will need to return the product for testing and analysis, and if it is malfunctioning, we will ship you a replacement free of charge. Read all about it on our warranty policy page.

Practical read range/performance expectation

Passive RFID and NFC chips are magnetically coupled devices that power themselves and communicate data over a shared magnetic field the reader generates. This means their effective read range and performance depends entirely on how well the antenna coils of both the tag and reader couple with each other. This typically means the shape, size, and orientation of both antennas must be complimentary.

Unfortunately, most reader devices, including mobile phones, typically have antennas designed with thin PCB traces made into blocky rectangular shapes that lay along a flat plane. These antenna designs are great for coupling with and reading large flat labels and access cards which also share this antenna shape, but they have a hard time coupling to the very small cylindrical antenna coil inside our x-series chips. Most mobile phones and reader devices have a “sweet spot” or two that must be located and used each time to get consistent results. Other devices, such as the Samsung Ezon electronic deadbolt lock, sometimes use wire wound coil antenna loops inside, which work much more reliably with small glass transponders like our x-series chips. You should not expect your USB reader or mobile device to achieve the same read range with our x-series chips that you normally get with a label tag or card style tag. Here are some example videos detailing typical read performance and how to find that “sweet spot”.

The xLED can help! The xLED is a diagnostic device that mimics the x-series antenna coil winding and shows you the best possible location and rotation/orientation for holding your x-series transponder up to any reader. That’s why we include it in our deluxe bundle!

How/where to install the xBT tag? Aftercare? What to expect?

 Typically, our x-series transponders are installed into the webbing between the metacarpal bones of the index finger and thumb, resting parallel to the index metacarpal. However, the xBT’s thermal sensor provides the most stable output when installed away from extremities and closer to the core of the body. Temperature in the hands and arms can fluctuate rapidly with changes in surrounding ambient temperature, and are not ideal for recording stable thermal readings.

The best installation location for the xBT tested so far has been in the skin near the arm pit, but not actually in the fold of the arm pit. For example, the area on the inside of the upper arm which rests against your torso when your arm is down would work well. Similarly, the torso area just under the arm pit which is completely covered when the arm is down, is also an acceptable location.

For aftercare information and what to expect, please read our X-Series FAQ page.

How does BioBond anti-migration coating affect removal/replacement?

 BioBond is a porous material that, when applied to the bioglass encasement of the chip, forms an “anti-migration cap” which promotes tissue growth throughout its porous structure. The goal is to secure the tag and stop it migrating by literally letting the body grow into it to hold the chip in place.

The xBT was designed for use in animals by Destron Fearing. The reason why the BioBond coating is necessary has to do with animal (dogs, cats, horses, etc.) physiology, as well as the method and care taken during placement. Our other x-series products do not have this coating in order to facilitate easy removal or replacement. Once tissue has grown into the BioBond coating around the xBT tag, removal or replacement of the xBT will be extremely difficult, but not impossible.

Can I get an MRI? What about airport security? Playing sports? etc.

You have questions! That’s understandable. The short answer is; it’s all good. If you’re looking for more specific answers, we have an extensive FAQ page that deals with many of the most commonly asked questions regarding installation of our x-series transponders.

dNExT

The successor to the flexNExT! Massive range for the NTAG216 and T5577! These are built to order with zero to eight LED nails. Colors available (in the order pictured from left to right): green, red, aqua, blue, and white. If you want the best performance, the LED quantity should be limited to three. When you order, let us know the colors of LEDs you want in the order you want–if any. If no notes are left, we’ll assume you want no LEDs. The price is the same regardless of LED count.

Where should you install this? Great question! Unlike our biopolymer, the resin doesn’t have any flex to it. As such, the hand would be a poor choice. The back of the wrist (where a watch tends to be worn but do not wear a watch over it) or the arm are good choices.

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. The dNExT transponder has not been tested or certified by any regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The dNExT is a jumbo-sized, bioresin version of our easily injectable 2mm diameter NExT dual frequency chip implant. It has the same NTAG216 and T5577 chips inside, only super-sized to drastically improve performance… and we can put some blinky lights on too.

Professional installation notes

Installation of a dNExT device should always be done by a professional. We do not presume to know better than your professional installer what the correct installation method for your body and desired implant location might be. Always defer to your installation professional’s opinion on placement and installation procedure.

Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)
Do not install atop or parallel to any joints
Bioresin is rigid–the radius of the hand is NOT suited to an implant this large

NTAG216 Security

The NTAG216 was designed for use in more typical NFC applications such as smart posters, labels, and other disposable use cases where the memory contents would typically be written and then locked so it could not be changed. This is done using built-in “lock bytes” which are OTP (one time programmable). That means that once the lock bytes are turned on to protect memory blocks, they can never be unlocked. Once any memory block is locked, it will forever be read-only, which is not ideal for the dNExT. Many NFC applications offer ways to “lock” or “protect” your tag, which will end up locking the tag read-only. Because of this, we have disabled the ability to change or set the lock bits in the dNExT’s NTAG216 chip.

Before disabling the lock bytes however, there is one page of user memory we do lock down as read-only. That is the CC or Capability Container, located in memory page 03. This page of 4 bytes is required to have a specific format of data so the tag can be recognized and used as an NFC Type 2 tag. This memory page is also special in that the data stored there uses OTP bits, or “One Time Programmable” bits, meaning once a bit is flipped from 0 to 1, it cannot be flipped back to 0. It is critical that this memory page be locked as read-only so a malicious attacker can’t mess up your Capability Container, thus ruining the chip for use as an NFC compliant transponder. We set lock bytes to mark the Capability Container as read-only, then we disable the lock bytes so no other memory pages can be permanently set as read-only.

In addition to lock bytes, the NTAG216 offers a 32bit password protection function. It can be used to password-protect just writing to or both reading from and writing to the user memory space of the NTAG216 chip. Regardless of what some NFC smartphone apps indicate, it is not possible to remove or disable the password. It is only possible to set the password to the default hexadecimal value of 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF. If the password is set to the default value, then anyone could easily authenticate, change the password, then write data or change protection options for your tag, and change the password to some unknown value. Because it is also possible to protect memory blocks from unauthenticated reads using a password, this could make the tag completely useless by not allowing any memory blocks to even be read. We set a default password value of 0x4E 0x45 0x78 0x54 or NExT, but strongly suggest you change it after installation.

Finally, many of the critical configuration bytes used by the NTAG216 chip are stored in the last few memory pages of the tag. This means that it may be possible for an NFC application that does not properly detect or honor the dNExT’s NTAG216 chip memory schema to accidentally attempt to write binary or NDEF record data (the data you’re trying to store on the tag) overtop of the configuration bytes. For example, if the data you are attempting to write is longer than the user memory blocks available, the remainder of the data might be written overtop of configuration bytes, which contain settings that are potentially dangerous to modify such as the config lock byte. It is not possible to disable the configuration lock byte, so accidentally writing to that byte could result in your configuration being irreversibly locked. We password-protect the configuration bytes from being able to be written to or updated using the password feature of the NTAG216 chip. Overall, the dNExT leaves the factory with the entire user memory space accessible and writable, while at the same time the configuration bytes and password values at the bottom end of the NTAG216 chip’s memory space are protected.

Once your dNExT is installed, you’ll be able to use any NFC smartphone app to write data to the tag and not need to be afraid of accidentally locking the tag, or changing the configuration bytes, or someone maliciously locking your tag or changing your password. We suggest using NXP’s TagWriter app.

More Details

WARNING This kit definitely contains dangerous things. The dT5 transponder device has not been tested or certified by any regulatory agency for implantation or use inside the human body. Use of this device is strictly at your own risk.

The dT5 is one of our next generation, high performance, 125kHz RFID transponders with a T5577 chip inside. The T5577 is an emulator that can behave like many different common low frequency chip types, including EM41xx, EM4200, HID 1326 ProxCard II, HID 1346 ProxCard III, Indala, Pyramid, Viking, AMV, Presco (and more) access cards and keyfobs. It is compatible with many inexpensive but plentiful OEM and commercial low frequency RFID readers and stand-alone access controllers like our xEM Access Controller.

The dT5 is coated in USP Class VI, ISO 10993 tested bioresin which gives it a thin profile and rigid structure suitable for installation just about anywhere. They are packaged in a gas plasma sterilized tyvek sterilization pouch that contains the flex implant which is then packaged inside a sealed polymer bag.

The performance and range of the dT5 (or now discontinued flexEM) vs the xEM is significant.

What can this chip implant do?

• Some types of access control applications
• Copy other LF chip IDs to this chip

What this chip implant can’t do

• Share data with NFC enabled smartphones
• Trigger events on NFC devices like smartphones
• Can’t make payments with this chip implant
• Chip implants can’t be used for GPS or tracking

Professional installation notes

Installation of a dT5 device should always be done by a professional.

Do not install under any gripping surface (e.g. no palm side installations)
Do not install atop or parallel to any joints (flex devices are only “semi-flexible”)

Scalpel Install Procedure

Make a 18mm wide incision in skin

Important things to know about the dT5

– The bioresin is ISO 10993 and USP Class IV tested and certified, however the final product has not been tested post-processing, meaning material changes during processing could render the final product unsafe in some way.

– There is no “preferred” location for installation of a disc device. Customers are free to install a disc into any area of the body their installation professional is comfortable with, as long as it is in the fascia layer between dermis and muscle tissue and not in an area of flexion or under a gripping surface. We urge you to think about easier locations like the arm/wrist.

Ring Sizing Guide

The most frequent reason customers wish to return or exchange their purchase of a smart ring wearable is due to sizing problems. We have created a ring sizing guide to help determine the correct ring size before placing an order. A universal standard paper size does not exist, therefore we’ve created a US Letter size (8.5″ by 11″) version of the guide, and an international A4 size version of the guide. Print the appropriate size guide on your printer at 100% scale. Do not print using “fit to page” or any other setting which compresses the printed image.

Once you receive your ring, please check your ring’s size is correct before doing any programming of the chips within the ring. Any returns or exchanges must be done before any programming changes are made to the chips inside the ring.

“magic” Mifare chips

The Mifare “classic” S50 1k chip?

For many years the Mifare MF1ICS50 1k chip was used for all kinds of applications as a “secure chip” for everything from access control to stored value cards, and used for making localized payments within closed systems like public transit and laundry services. However, it uses a security mechanism called “crypto1” which is a simple, proprietary encryption mechanism that hardly has anything to do with modern cryptography. It has been broken for many years now, but the sheer number of systems out there that still use it means the Mifare S50 1k will continue to be used by legacy systems around the world for years to come.

However, the ability to break crypto1 and get at the normally protected data does not necessarily help you if you want to copy that data to another Mifare S50 1k card, fob, or tag. That’s because real Mifare chips do not allow you to change the data in sector 0, which is where special manufacturing information is held as well as the 4 byte non-unique ID or serial number of the chip. You could copy all the data from the user memory sectors to a new Mifare 1k chip, but basically any machine reading the cloned card will know that the serial number doesn’t match or is not registered with the system and will likely ignore the card or even alert security to a possible attempt at something malicious.

“magic” Mifare 1k chips

A “magic” Mifare chip (or magic chip) is a special grey-market chip made in China that can emulate the memory structure and functionality of real Mifare chips, but also allow sector 0 to be modified. This means the serial number and manufacturing data of a Mifare “magic” chip can be changed to act as a perfect clone of a real Mifare S50 1k chip… even the serial number.

gen1a vs gen2

There are now several “generations” of these types of chips, but the most common are still gen1a and gen2. Other types of “magic” chips include the ability to emulate more than just mifare “classic” S50 1k chips, but here we will focus just on the magic Mifare S50 1k (4 byte ID) chip emulators.

More details…

gen1a
The gen1a magic Mifare chip requires a special back door command that opens up all sectors to writing, including sector 0. The advantage of this is that even if you have accidentally locked any memory sectors or lost the crypto1 keys for any particular sector, you can still read and overwrite all sectors after issuing the back door command. In short, the back door command removes all security completely for every sector.

The down side is, the back door command is issued to the chip after it supposedly enters the halt state, which means only certain devices can issue the back door command. Smartphones generally cannot do this because the chips and firmware in the phone do not allow further communications after the halt state has been entered. Furthermore, certain readers, especially in Asia, look for magic chips by issuing the back door command and if the chip answers, it shuts down to avoid allowing a possibly cloned chip to access whatever door or service the reader is attached to.

gen2
The gen2 magic Mifare chip has no back door command. All sectors are equally open for writing, as long as access bit permissions and keys allow. The advantage of the gen2 magic chip is that even NFC capable smartphones can issue standard write commands for any sector, including sector 0. This means a smartphone app like MCT could be used change the ID of the chip along with all the data in the manufacturing block. In addition to this, readers looking for magic chips ultimately have no good way to really tell if the chip is a magic chip or not.

The down side is that the real Mifare S50 1k chip’s operation is emulated completely and accurately. There is no back door, so if one or more sectors on the chip become protected by access bit changes, you need valid keys in order to make further changes. In addition to this, if the access bits are misconfigured or bad data is written, the sector becomes unreadable and locked, and there is no way to recover that sector… it will be locked forever.

Changing the ID of a “magic” Mifare chip

Writing to sector 0 of a “magic” chip in order to change it’s ID depends on which version you have.

gen1a
To change the ID of a gen1a magic chip, you will need to use a proxmark3 or some special software that can issue the gen1a back door command to the magic chip through a common reader like the ARC122U.

-todo-

gen2
You can write to sector 0 of a magic gen2 chip like any other sector on a Mifare “classic” S50 1k chip. That means you can even use an NFC smartphone and an app to do it.

-todo-

Cloning card data to a “magic” chip

The first thing you have to do is ensure your source card or fob is a 4 byte “Classic” 1k card, not a new 7 byte “Mifare 1k” card. With the discovery of Crypto1 vulnerabilities in the “Classic” Mifare S50 1k and S70 4k chips, NXP (the company who makes Mifare chips) released a number of different updated versions of Mifare chips. These include Mifare Plus 1k and a Mifare “Classic” 1k EV1 (evolution one) chip. The memory structures of these new chips are identical to the real “Classic” 1k chips but they have 7 byte UIDs not 4 byte IDs. While new attacks on these new chip types do exist, success is limited and you will not be able to copy the complete 7 byte ID number to the gen1a chip since it only supports 4 byte IDs.

gen1a
By far the most powerful tool to use is the Proxmark3 - an RFID diagnostics and security research tool that is open source, so it comes in many flavors, shapes, an sizes. It’s flexibility and ability to update the firmware to support the latest security tactics and tools means it’s a great investment for anyone wanting to experiment with RFID. While we do not offer a guide for how to use the Proxmark3 to clone Mifare cards to a “magic” chip, there are plenty of other guides already written that detail how it’s done.

https://scund00r.com/all/rfid/2018/06/05/proxmark-cheatsheet.html

If you don’t have a proxmark3 but you do have a USB reader like the ACR122U, there are a few tools you can use. Here’s an example of how to use them.

gen2
If you have a gen2 chip and want to clone some data to it, you can use an Android smartphone app called MCT. It’s not the most friendly tool, but it works.

The video embedded below drops you right into the section at 42 seconds in which talks about how to program and update the gen2 magic chip in our Magic Ring product using the MCT app for Android.

This is a fantastic, very informative and thorough thread.

I just thought I would add the following information, as this is the most comprehensive thread on the subject.

On this Forum, we generally refer to the chip types as gen1a or gen2 , which is accurate terminology and consistent throught the forum, and thanks to this thread most people understand what you are referring to when you mention them.

When it comes to buying youself test cards etc.
“gen1a” and “gen2” doesn’t always yield the best search results, especially on Chinese shopping sites.

In my experience

You could obviously try a very full description or snippets from one such as

Magic Mifare Classic gen1a 1k 13.56Mhz S50 IC

You will probably get a good number of results, but alot will be red herrings.

From the example I gave above, 2 of the better search terms would be

S50
IC

With those terms you should have narrowed down your results, BUT if you want to be closer to 100% that you are buying exactly what you want, BUT to differentiate between the chips, Look for, or search for

UID = gen1a

CUID = gen2

Personally I have had a very good success rate using this.

I hope this is of some help and saves someone waiting 4-6 week delivery only to get the wrong product

@Jirvin let me know if you want me to shift this elsewhere, and I’ll find another home for it.

Ring Sizing Guide

The most frequent reason customers wish to return or exchange their purchase of a smart ring wearable is due to sizing problems. We have created a ring sizing guide to help determine the correct ring size before placing an order. A universal standard paper size does not exist, therefore we’ve created a US Letter size (8.5″ by 11″) version of the guide, and an international A4 size version of the guide. Print the appropriate size guide on your printer at 100% scale. Do not print using “fit to page” or any other setting which compresses the printed image.

Once you receive your ring, please check your ring’s size is correct before doing any programming of the chips within the ring. Any returns or exchanges must be done before any programming changes are made to the chips inside the ring.

9187H–RFID–07/14
4.5 HV Generator
This on-chip charge pump circuit generates the high voltage required to program the EEPROM.
4.6 DC Supply
Power is supplied to the IDIC externally via the two coil connections. The IC rectifies and regulates this RF source, and uses
it to generate its supply voltage.
4.7 Power-On Reset (POR)
The power-on reset (POR) circuit blocks the voltage supply to the IDIC until an acceptable voltage threshold has been
reached.
4.8 Clock Extraction
The clock extraction circuit uses the external RF signal as its internal clock source.
4.9 Controller
The control logic module executes the following functions:
● Load mode register with configuration data from EEPROM block 0 after power on and during reading
● Load option register with the settings for the analog front end stored in EEPROM page 1, block 3 after power on and
during reading
● Control all EEPROM memory read/write access and data protection
● Handles the downlink command decoding detecting protocol violations and error conditions
4.10 Mode Register
The mode register maintains a readable shadow copy of the configuration data held in block 0 of the EEPROM. It is
continually refreshed during read mode and (re-)loaded after every POR event or reset command. On delivery, the mode
register is pre-programmed according to Table 10-1 on page 39.
4.11 Modulator
The modulator encodes the serialized EEPROM data for transmission to a tag reader or base station. Several types of
modulation are available including Manchester, bi-phase, FSK, PSK, and NRZ.
